Health Insurance: How Does It Work?
Four Questions to Ask About Health Care Reform
We rarely have to ask how car insurance or home insurance work. What is it that makes health insurance so much more complicated — with individual mandates, single or multiple payers, and so on? Since Congress is (once again) talking about changing how health care works in America, it may be a good time to explain what makes it so strange. This thing we sometimes call “health insurance” is actually a fusion of three different things, only one and a half of which are “insurance” at all. I’m going to walk through the basics you need to know, and end up with a set of four questions you can ask about any health care proposal that will let you understand what people are really talking about.
(I’m not going to tell you what I think the right answers are, though. This article is to help you ask the right questions — and I’m interested in your answers.)
Not as bad as it looks: this is a mass casualty drill at the Naval Medical Center, San Diego.
Let’s start by talking about what insurance actually is. The first modern version of insurance was invented in the Netherlands in the 1600’s, when people were finding that sending a ship on a trading voyage could be very profitable. The good news was that you could make back the whole cost of your investment (a ship, a crew, some things to start trading with) in just a few voyages; the bad news is that a lot of voyages also ended up with shipwrecks, which would take your entire investment to the bottom of the ocean.
Let’s say for simplicity that it would take you ten voyages to make back the cost of a ship, and one voyage out of twenty got shipwrecked. Suddenly, your life depends a lot on luck: if that shipwreck happens on your eleventh voyage, you’ve got enough saved up to buy a new ship and keep going. If that shipwreck happened on the tenth voyage, though, you were screwed.
Pretty soon, some fairly wealthy men figured out a way to fix this: they would offer an “insurance contract,” where before each voyage, a shipowner would pay them one-twentieth the cost of a ship plus a fee, and if they were shipwrecked, they would get paid the full cost of getting a new ship. Both sides came out happy: on the average, the insurer was earning the fee for each voyage, and the shipowners had turned an unpredictable, possibly catastrophic, expense into a regular, predictable one.
This is the simplest kind of insurance: it takes a large (but known) expense that might happen at an unpredictable time, and splits it up into a lot of small expenses that you can plan for. Your homeowner’s insurance today is basically the same kind of thing.
There have been lots of improvements to this idea over the years. One that’s particularly relevant to us is actuarial science: the development of professional experts in figuring out the odds. In the story above, the insurer was charging one-twentieth the cost of the ship plus a fee, because he knew the cost of a ship and could estimate that one voyage in twenty shipwrecked. But if he predicted those odds wrong, he could be in trouble: too high an estimate would mean he was charging people too much, and they would go to his competitors (often just a few tables down at the café). Too low an estimate, and he’d be paying out more than he collected in premiums, and could go bankrupt within the week. So hiring a lot of clever people to figure out just how likely these events were became very important.
One of the first things actuaries realized is that not all voyages are equal. A trading voyage from Eemshaven to London is a lot less risky than one to Shanghai. A well-crewed boat in good repair is less risky than one that looks like it may sink if someone sneezes too loudly. An experienced crew is safer than a green one. This means that insurers could — and should — charge different voyages different rates. The perfect insurance contract is one where everyone knows the exact odds of something going wrong.
Each of these cases has something in common: everyone knows and can agree upon the price of the thing being insured. But sometimes, you want to insure against something that you know will be very expensive, but whose actual cost you don’t know ahead of time — say, the liability insurance on your car, which is insuring against the medical bills of someone injured in an accident. How does an insurer know how much to charge? And what if it’s a “catastrophic” event, one that ends up being so expensive that the total premiums that the person buying the insurance would never pay that much over their entire lives?
It turns out that you can meaningfully insure these too, so long as the actuaries can figure out the average costs, and figure out the odds of different possible expenses; you just spread these costs over the whole pool of insured people. If you know that one person out of every thousand will have a million-dollar expense, and you’ve got 10,000 customers, then you can expect to make $10M in payouts over the years, and price your premiums at $1,000 apiece plus a fee. This works out even though none of those ten people will ever pay $1M in premiums; the lucky ones pay, the unlucky ones get paid back.
At first glance, this kind of “catastrophic event insurance” works a lot like ordinary insurance; by spreading risk over the entire pool of insured people, it lets people insure not just against events which they could pay for if the cost were spread out over their entire lifetime (like ordinary insurance), but even against events which you couldn’t pay for.
But catastrophic insurance is only sort-of insurance: it has a fundamental problem. Imagine that one day, someone figures out that the one-in-1,000 odds above aren’t as simple as we thought: there are actually two groups of people (maybe good and bad drivers, or maybe people with different risks for some disease) that have different odds. That one-in-1,000 actually breaks down to 90% of people having a one-in-10,000 chance, and 10% of people having a one-in-100 chance. If you were charging people based on their odds, like ordinary insurance does, then 90% of people would be paying $100 instead of $1,000, and the other 10% would be paying $10,000.
What this means is that, when everyone is paying the same rate, the “safe” people are really subsidizing the “unsafe” people. And so long as nobody can tell which pool anyone is in, that’s how all insurance works. But as soon as people get a better understanding of risk, things change. If catastrophic insurance is being sold on the free market, things change quickly: even if one insurer decided to ignore it and keep charging everyone $1,000, someone else could show up and insure 90% of their customers for only $100. Pretty soon they’d have all of those customers, and the original insurer would be left with just the 10% with higher risk; they’d have to raise their rate to $10,000 just to avoid going bankrupt!
That is, everyone would end up charging the same rates that they would if this were ordinary insurance; there’s no way (in the free market) for the insurers to spread the costs around. It becomes impossible to insure against events which cost more than any one person could afford.
The only way to prevent this is to move away from a perfectly free market. If insurers were forbidden to change their rates or refuse customers based on this criterion, then you could keep everyone paying the same $1,000, and everyone would still be insured against this risk.
Of course, this doesn’t come for free; what you’ve effectively done is say that we will cover this risk, and everyone has to pony up to cover it. That is, this is a kind of tax; it can happen the way described above, with insurers required to cover something and the cost being spread across everyone insured, or it could be done as a literal tax, with everyone paying in and some central service paying out and no private companies involved, or as anything in between. Whether this is a good or bad idea depends on the situation.
The upshot is this: catastrophic insurance (which spreads people’s costs across the whole population) is unstable as a free-market good, because as knowledge of risks improves, it turns into “ordinary” insurance (which spreads an individual’s costs across time). If its cost as ordinary insurance is more than people can afford — that is, if the thing being insured against is something which people simply couldn’t pay for if it happened, like cancer treatment or accident liability — then that risk becomes uninsurable. The alternative is to make a social decision that payment for this (we can’t really call it “insurance” anymore) is going to be made out of a fund that everyone chips in to; which is to say, a tax, which pays for the benefit that people are now protected from a risk which can’t be protected against via insurance. That decision amounts to saying “everyone is chipping in to pay for X when it happens to people.”
So whenever there’s a kind of catastrophic event that people might want to insure against, we should think about it the same way we do about a tax. Is it worth it? How will the costs be distributed among people? How will the benefits be distributed? Is it better to do this with insurance rates or a literal tax? This is the question we have to ask about any kind of catastrophic insurance, whenever we either have figured out a way to split up the risk pool, or when we think that’s likely to happen in the near future.
There’s one other thing that turns out to work almost the same as catastrophic insurance: pre-existing conditions. These are just like ordinary medical conditions (either of the sort that require ordinary or catastrophic insurance), but it’s not about people with a high risk of having something, but people with a certainty of already having it. That means that the only reasonable “premium” you could charge them is the full cost of treatment plus a fee. Since that’s more than the cost of treatment, you would have to be an idiot to pay that; pre-existing conditions aren’t insurable at all.
Like with catastrophic insurance, we have two basic options: leave it to the market, with pre-existing conditions uninsurable, or require insurers by law to accept people with pre-existing conditions. (In fact, we always did this in some ways, because otherwise an insurer could say you had a “pre-existing” condition the moment you got sick, and kick you off insurance before paying a dime. That way they would get to keep all your premiums and never have to pay out anything, which would be fantastic from their perspective. Insurance contracts don’t allow this — but insurers are quite known for finding ways around that, such as pressuring employers to fire people whose family members are seriously ill, or face having their own premiums spike.)
The problem with requiring that insurers accept people with pre-existing conditions is what happens when people move from insurer to insurer. If insurers were required to accept you, you would just not bother having insurance at all until you got sick, and then get insurance, pay a small premium, and have everything paid for; the insurer would go bankrupt overnight. This is just the same as the situation with catastrophic insurance, except now instead of two insurers competing and all the low-risk people going to the cheap one, each insurer would be competing with “no insurance at all.”
This is the origin of the “individual mandate” in the ACA: if you want to require insurers to cover pre-existing conditions, you also have to ban individuals from not having insurance. And since literally banning it (with a prison sentence?) seems like a terrible idea, the ACA compromised with a fine.
If we put this together, there are two options for how you handle pre-existing conditions:
Option 1: Insurers aren’t required to cover pre-existing conditions; anyone who has to change insurers when they have an illness is uninsurable.
Option 2: Insurers are required to cover pre-existing conditions; we spread the cost out over everyone by requiring everyone to buy insurance.
There are three similar options for catastrophic insurance:
Option 1: Insurers can charge different risk groups different amounts for this kind of catastrophic event; catastrophic insurance turns into ordinary insurance as our understanding of risk gets better, and people at high risk for this event are uninsurable.
Option 2: Insurers are required to charge different risk groups the same for this kind of event; the cost of handling it is spread out over everyone through the premiums.
Option 3: Ordinary insurers don’t handle this kind of event at all; we set up a separate system that takes in a fee spread across everyone (i.e. a tax) and pays for treatment.
The first two options are just like the ones for pre-existing conditions. The analogue of the third one would be if we said that for any condition that can be pre-existing and that individuals couldn’t usefully pay for on the spot, the idea of “private insurance” doesn’t really work, and so we have a central system to handle it.
Summarized another way, “insurance” for catastrophic events or pre-existing conditions doesn’t really behave like insurance; if you try to sell that on the free market, it quickly ceases to exist. So if you want it to exist — that is, if you want there to be a payment mechanism other than cash on the barrelhead — for any such conditions, you have to create it outside the market, by law, and require the costs to be spread out. The difference between options 2 and 3 is just about whether private companies operate it day-to-day.
Any health care proposal that involves any spreading out of costs faces the same question as a tax proposal: how do we spread out that cost?
All three of these options have been used in real life. For pre-existing conditions, option 1 is what we did in the US before the ACA; option 2 is what we do today. For catastrophic conditions, most kinds of insurance start out as option 1 and gradually evolve to option 2 as our understanding of risk gets better; if something is completely uninsurable and no company wants to deal with it (like flood insurance for houses, uninsurable because everyone gets flooded at once) then we often move to option 3.
Option 3 is also popular in many countries for health insurance, where it’s called a “single-payer” system. This has the advantage of combining a solution to the catastrophic and pre-existing care system with the fact that health care access doesn’t work well on a market, either; it’s basically saying that health insurance, as a whole, doesn’t really work as a free-market good, and if we’re going to have it we have to build it as a big social project, much like we do the roads. It has the downside of pushing everyone into a single system, which is why many countries actually use a hybrid: there’s a central single-payer system that everyone uses, and you can also buy additional insurance (with maybe access to different kinds of hospital or doctor as well) on the open market.
We also don’t have to make the same choice for each kind of insurance. Your car’s liability insurance, for example, works by something between options 1 and 2, while if you have any flood insurance you bought it through a semi-governmental system using option 3.
One final thing to remember is that whenever we’re “spreading out the cost,” there’s no opt-out by definition. But some people can’t pay that cost; what happens to them? This is the same problem that we encounter with any tax — taxes are, after all, just us paying for something (be it roads or armies) that we’ve decided as a society we need to build, even though there’s no good way to do it individually. So any health care proposal that involves any spreading out of costs faces the same question as a tax proposal: how do we spread out that cost? (And if we’re using a fine, rather than the tax system, to charge it, what happens to people who can’t pay?)
So let’s look at health care. Health care includes the full range of event types: manageable and predictable events, like kids getting strep or breaking their arms, and giant and unpredictable ones, like cancer. It includes lots of “pre-existing conditions” if there’s any situation in which you might have to change insurers, especially if you can’t control that. (Such as due to a layoff)

But the thing we call “health insurance” also contains a third item, which has nothing to do with insurance at all — instead, it has to do with the strange way medical payments work.
If you walk into a hospital and ask how much a procedure will cost, you probably won’t get a straight answer. If you do, it will be heart-stoppingly high: $250 for a small bottle of apple juice as a “rehydration supplement,” $1,000 for ten minutes of a doctor’s time, and so on. The reason is that health care is paid for through a complicated system which barely involves either the doctor or the patient; instead, the medical facility bills the insurance company. And a big part of the contract negotiation between the two, when that provider and that insurer agree to work together, is an agreement on how much each item will cost. But the resulting contract is secret; neither side wants its competitors to know what kind of deal it made. The “official” prices that a provider charges are nothing more than the starting point in a negotiation, where the insurer might want lower costs for blood tests and accept higher costs for hospital beds.
But if you walk into a hospital without insurance, you’re not covered by any of those deals — so the price you’ll get charged is the list price, a price never meant to be paid by anyone. And those are prices which would instantly drive someone into bankruptcy.
(Then this whole story is repeated when insurance companies negotiate with employers to sell them insurance for their workers; the cost you pay if you need to buy insurance individually is far higher than the cost a big company that’s buying policies for ten thousand people is paying.)
What ends up happening in practice is that if you don’t have insurance, you simply don’t go in for routine care; you can only go to the emergency room, where they are required to treat everyone who comes in the door. (Which is another example of a societal decision to subsidize something!) Of course, you then get billed a tremendous amount, and have to try to negotiate with the hospital to reduce this to something payable — but now they have all the leverage, since you owe a debt.
So this third aspect of health insurance really has nothing to do with insurance at all: it’s that being signed up with an insurer gives you access to that insurer’s negotiated prices, without which you can’t get access to medical care at all.
We’ve already seen that ordinary insurance works well on free markets, and catastrophic and pre-existing insurance doesn’t work there at all. Health care access sits somewhere in the middle: you could sell it on the free market, but that turns out to be bad for almost everyone. For example, if health care access were something you bought, but emergency rooms were still required to treat anyone who came in the door (changing which is likely to go down very badly with anyone who’s sworn the Hippocratic Oath), then this would be equivalent to saying “people who can’t afford health care access go to the ER.” But emergency treatment is a lot more expensive than preventive care, not least because by the time you’ve gone to the ER (and are facing the potentially ruinous bills that would follow), you’re a lot sicker than you would have been beforehand. That imposes costs on the hospitals (who have lots of indigent patients to treat), on the people who are getting much sicker, on their employers or customers who have people who are sicker and can’t work, on their families, on other patients at the ER who have to wait because there are a lot of seriously ill people showing up who wouldn’t have been as sick otherwise, and most dangerously of all, on society as a whole when contagious diseases start going around — pertussis doesn’t give a damn what kind of health care policy you’ve put in place or how much money you have.
That is, a sick population creates lots of deadweight costs for everybody around, and preventive care reduces those costs across the board, creating a net profit for society. This means there are some kinds of care which everyone has an incentive to make as widely available as possible. You could sell access to those on the free market, but it’s almost certainly a terrible idea.
To sum up, we have three different things, all bundled under the misleading name “health insurance:”
Ordinary health insurance, which splits up the cost of your expected lifetime medical bills over time;
Catastrophic health insurance, which splits up the cost of rare expenses so big that people couldn’t pay them across everyone; and
Access to the health care system itself.
And these have different requirements. Most importantly, ordinary health insurance is something you can sell on the free market — but catastrophic health insurance, and insurance for pre-existing conditions, isn’t. It exists if and only if we decide to spread out its costs across the wider population, which means some kind of law (basically, a tax) to do it. Health care access can be sold as a free-market good, but there are some aspects of health care access which, if we make them available to the public as a whole, create huge across-the-board wins.
When you start seeing proposals for health care laws, here are some questions you should ask:
How does the proposal handle people getting health care access? If it doesn’t simply give it to everyone by fiat, what happens for people without it? If it does, how is that managed and paid for? Which kinds of care, if any, do we actively try to make available for everybody?
Does the proposal provide ordinary health insurance at market rates? If not, how does it change that?
How does the proposal handle catastrophic and pre-existing coverage? Does it use option 1 (don’t insure it), option 2 (private insurers but we spread out the cost), or option 3 (one central insurer and we spread out the cost)?
If we are spreading out the costs for any situation, what happens to people who can’t afford that cost?
These are the questions you have to ask no matter whose proposal you’re looking at. Do we insure people with a high risk of cancer? If so, how do we spread out the cost? What mechanism do we use to collect that — insurance premiums and fines, an overall tax payment, something else? If not, what do we do with people at risk for cancer?
I’m not telling you the answers to any of these questions — just showing you the questions you’ll have to ask. The answers are good things to argue over with your friends and Congressthings.
The law we have today in the US is a strange sort of mish-mash. Everyone is required to get insurance, with various exceptions, or pay a fine. That insurance provides a combination of health care access, ordinary health insurance, and catastrophic and pre-existing care insurance, all done using option 2. The requirement to get insurance is the way we spread out the cost, and there’s a system of refunds to reduce the cost for people who can’t afford it. (Unfortunately, because of Congressional roadblock, those refunds are set at the “first guess” values which were in the original bill, and nobody’s been able to adjust them to what people actually need — which is what had to be done for every other system like this in the world.) People in any of those exceptions who don’t get insurance get none of the above, including health care access.
There are various ideas about “health savings accounts” being floated, and if one gets suggested soon, you should ask these questions about it. HSA’s on their own provide ordinary insurance, but neither access nor catastrophic insurance; they literally mean that you save up your money against the chance of getting sick in the future. (In this way, they’re awfully similar to “no health insurance,” since you could always do that to begin with — unless you find yourself like that shipowner whose ship went down before he had ten successful voyages, in which case you’re SOL.) This means that HSA’s have to be coupled with something else… but what else? That’s the $100-billion question.
As for other ideas… who knows? Take a look at whatever comes up, and ask these questions about it. It’ll make it a lot easier for you to navigate between competing ideas.

Disrupting insurance
For most of 2015 I have been banging on about disrupting insurance (or Instech, if you like that kind of jargon). I’d like to use this blog post to talk about why I find it exciting.
1. Insurance is an enormous market
Life insurance premiums are $2.3 trillion globally. Non-life insurance premiums are $1.4 trillion globally. (both numbers are from 2012, from Mckinsey report linked to below). I don’t get to write the word trillion often when looking at market sizes.
Importantly for a European VC, Europe is a disproportionately large chunk of this, coming in at $700B of life and $400B of non-life . And London, as the place insurance was invested, remains its biggest global hub
2. Incumbents face a number of challenges
The insurance industry in Europe and the US is mostly composed today of large traditional insurers who have been operating for decades or centuries. They have struggled to adapt to a digital age, as shown by the graph from BCG below. Similarly to banks, their backend software and underwriting is tied into legacy software from previous decades, with major system integration challenges.
https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/insurance_technology_strategy_evolution_revolution_how_insurers_stay_relevant_digital_world/
Insurers also have very little contact with their customers, contributing to low brand loyalty and retention.
In many countries and verticals insurance is still mostly distributed via expensive offline broker networks. Insurers are often tied to these networks, making it very hard for them to move to direct/online distribution. For a typical insurer distribution costs are significantly higher than all their other non-claims costs combined. Regulatory change in some countries is forcing insurers to make brokerage costs more explicit, which could well lead to customer backlash
3. Technology can be highly disruptive in insurance
Technology can have a huge impact on every important aspect of insurance. Distribution was the first part of insurance to be disrupted, with insurance comparison engines such as Moneysupermarket and Check24. Further disruptive mobile-first distribution models are emerging. On the underwriting side there is a huge volume of new data available (telematics, mobile phone, health tracking etc.) with which to make decisions. And there are new machine learning techniques to work with existing data. Smartphones allow a much more efficient and pleasant claims experience. Personalization software and machine learning enable ‘segment of one’ insurance. The list goes on. You can download a good report on this by BCG here
4. There are obstacles to entering the industry
It wouldn’t be an achievement if it was too easy. Insurance presents startups with a number of barriers to entry, of which the most significant are:
Regulation. Insurance is (with good reason) a highly regulated industry, and regulations vary by country (and by state in the US). To get going in the UK, for example, you need to get into the nitty gritty of brokers, MGAs, reinsurers, Solvency II, warehousing etc etc. You also need to understand a different set of accounting standards and terminology
Balance sheet. Once you get through the regulation above, you need to prove that you have the balance sheet to be able to pay up for claims in any eventuality. This requires serious capital before you can write your first policy.
Partnering with incumbents. Both of the above make it near-impossible to start afresh, unless you can raise Oscar-like $100M+ sums . Any other Instech startup is going to need to partner with existing insurers. This presents a number of challenges and limits flexibility. Some insurers are trying to encourage innovation (e.g. axastrategicventures.com/) but good intentions are confronted by big company politics, vested interests and ‘not invented here’ syndrome.
Historic data. If you are going to get into underwriting insurance you need historic claims data on which to base your decisions. However this data is privately held by insurers. Building up enough data over a long enough time frame (given that claims are infrequent events) is a real challenge. Without it there is a danger of startups mispricing risk.
5. These obstacles put off the big tech players
For the likes of Alphabet/Google, Facebook and Amazon insurance is too hard and too boring. When you have a huge warchest self-driving cars and drones are much more interesting areas to explore. In the war for engineering talent it is hard to get your best developers to work on financial services. When I was with Google in 2007–09 I worked on the early days of ‘Google Compare’. Despite much hand-wringing in the insurance industry this hasn’t gone anywhere. It’s just not high enough up Google’s priority list.

6. Despite the obstacles there are success stories
Ma Mingzhe http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/business/chinese-insurers-regulatory-win-benefits-a-leaders-family.html?_r=0
Ping An is one of the most impressive growth stories of any company globally. It was founded in 1988 in Shenzhen and was the first insurance company in China to adopt a shareholding structure. It took the nascent Chinese insurance industry and put a rocket under it, going IPO in 2004 at a $10B valuation,. It is now worth $100B. Ping An has always been a technology-led company and continues to lead the way in tech-led innovation. You can read more on this in the BCG reports below.
Moneysupemarket was the first player to really crack insurance comparison, allowing users to type on their details once and receive competing quotes from dozens of insurers. It was quickly copied, leading to a fierce TV and Google ad spending war with Comparethemarket, Confused and Gocompare that continues to this day. Despite this it is still worth almost $3B.
esure was founded in 2000, went public in 2013 and is now worth $1.5B. Its success has been built on on efficient low cost operations, and building brands (both esure and Sheilas’ Wheels ). It also owns Gocompare, one of the players in the UK comparison market.
7. There are a number of impressive startups emerging, but there is room for plenty more
Over the last year I have seen a step change in the number of startups going after insurance. But this change has been from ‘almost none’ to ‘a trickle’. Tiny in comparison to the huge number of startups going after the similar-sized fintech market.
Below I highlight a few of the areas in which I see Instech startups emerging.
Insurance distribution beyond comparison:
This is the most obvious area for startups to address, as it is not subject to many of the challenges above (less regulated, no balance sheet, no underwriting). A few interesting new players:
Knip. Mobile-first insurance concierge. Initial proposition for users is to remove admin pain: have all of your insurance policies in one place. Over time there is the potential to be a user’s trusted insurance advisor, recommending where they should increase/decrease cover and who they should insure with. Started in Switzerland, now taking on German market with competition from Safe and Clark. Policy Genius in the US is a different twist on the insurance concierge concept.
Boughtbymany. Social distribution for niche insurance. Boughtbymany finds niche groups who have challenges finding good insurance today (e.g. diabeticus, young drivers). It plugs into these affinity groups to push specially-designed insurance products to them.

Simplesurance. Seamless insurance cross-sell at checkout. The idea of selling insurance for high value items at point of purchase is not a new one. Simplesurance’s innovation is to make it as frictionless as possible for users and online retailers.
New forms of capital provision / peer to peer
In our persistent low interest rate environment new capital is flowing into the insurance industry in search of returns. One manifestation of this is hedge funds getting into reinsurance.
As a startup one opportunity is peer to peer insurance, where a group of members pay out cover some or all of claims made by the group. In some ways this goes back to the original concept of cooperative insurance. The advantages should be less fraud, lower acquisition costs (through referrals/social), greater loyalty and over time better pricing.
Friendsurance in Berlin was the first company with this approach.
Guevara in London is a different take on the P2P concept.
New sources of data
Connected devices and other online data offer insurers a huge amount of additional data on their insured risks. The first success story has been telematics for car insurance, where your driving behaviour affects your premium. A number of good businesses have been created, such as Insurethebox which sold 75% of the business at a valuation of ~$200M earlier this year. However so far telematics has remained a niche product, in particular addressing young drivers. Connected cars and ubiquitous smartphones will take it to the mass market.
Going forward there are many more opportunities to use connected hardware to refine insurance: wearable devices for healthcare, smart homes for home insurance, mobile phones for almost anything. There is also the opportunity to use people’s online presence and social networks to reduce fraud and (possibly) improve underwriting.
A few examples in this area:
Climate Corp Collecting weather data with high precision, offering farmers crop insurance and in depth analytics.
Metromile. In the car insurance telematics space, but using your smartphone to collect data, and a new pricing approach (pay per mile).
Vitality Keeping fit and healthy reduces your health insurance costs. Data takin in from partners and wearable devices. Has grown to 5.5M members. Oscar are also using data from wearable devices for their insurance.
Reinventing the insurance experience
This is a broad category, including changing how claims are handled, how insurance is sold and how it is bundled with other services.
Oscar is the best example of this, reinventing US medical insurance from the bottom up. It has been well covered by the tech press so I won’t go into it further here.
Aircare is part of Berkshire Hathaway, but worth a quick mention as it eliminates claims completely — it automatically pays out if your flight is delayed. Claims management is the most painful part of dealing with an insurer, with expensive offline measures to try to combat fraud. As everything we do becomes connected (starting with our car) the concept of ‘claiming’ may become an anachronism.
New verticals
There is always a new category emerging for insurance. Smartphone insurance has seen huge growth. Cyberinsurance is a current hot topic. However addressing these new lines of business is something that insurance insiders are pretty good at. Unless a startup can come in with a real tech advantage (which in cyberinsurance might be possible) the worry is that new segments quickly become competitive.
New markets.
The insurance market is still in its early stages in much of the developing world, offering opportunity for land grab. Compare Asia is an example of one company addressing this. DirectAsia, acquired by Hiscox, is another.
SaaS to help the insurance industry keep up.
The insurance industry is more than big enough for a SaaS provider focussed on the industry to build a $B business. There is a lot of excel still being used. The question is which parts of insurance require unique software, as opposed to a slight customisation of generic business intelligence, CRM or machine learning SaaS packages. A couple of insurance-specific SaaS companies are Quantemplate, offering business intelligence and data warehousing, and Shift Technology in fraud detection. Balderton’s portfolio company InterResolve are a different sort of B2B insurance company, with a technology-led approach to insurance claims mediation.
What I am looking for as a VC in insurance
Finally, a quick summary of what I look for as a VC in insurance startups:
Founding team who combine deep understanding of the insurance industry with an external, tech-led DNA. This probably means two founders, or a truly exceptional founder who can combine both. This is not an industry you can bluff your way through. On the flip side, I worry that a team of insurance industry insiders will struggle to break from industry norms.
Real tech DNA in the company (something I look for in any sector).
A clear focus on the customer, not the insurer / partner.
Simplicity: an ability to take a complex industry and present it in a beautiful way using plain language.
Mobile-first.
If you are an insurance startup in Europe than I haven’t spoken to before, please contact me!

Insurance Startups — Market Ecosystem Map

Last night, Sarah Tavel and I hosted a small dinner for founders and builders of insurance startups, and I was fascinated by this market. I wanted to dive deeper into this space and share some market observations.
Some caveats before we dive into the analysis.
This ecosystem map is not designed to be 100% comprehensive. It’s to understand all the different startups within the insurance space
If I am missing something, tweet me @mccannatron.
This space is developing quickly so take this into consideration.
Market Map
Graphic is above and a full list of all of the companies on the market map is below.
Reflections on the insurance market
The insurance market is huge — insurance premiums are $1.2 trillion dollars per year in the U.S. alone.
Of this total spend: 56% goes into life and health insurance and 44% goes into property/casualty insurance (which includes auto, home, and commercial).
Insurance today is typically sold through agents, which creates a steep customer acquisition cost for carriers — ~90% of premiums were sold through independent agents or affiliated agents of the insurer.
Two of the largest forms of insurance are conscripted: you must have auto insurance if you drive a vehicle and under Obamacare you must have health insurance. Getting consumers to care about other forms of insurance is no easy task.
What is changing in the insurance space (why now)
Most of the startups in the ecosystem are taking advantage of one or more of the major forces in the market today.
New channels (web/mobile) — Currently the bulk of insurance is sold through agents in-person or over the phone — however the next generation of consumers is used to purchasing goods directly online. Through mobile we now have the ability to sell insurance directly at the point of need, in real-time, and in shorter durations.
New sources of data (big data, machine intelligence, wearables, connected cars) — We now have the ability to collect more data which potentially could better inform the insurance risk models we use today.
Potential for new types of insurance — sharing economy (where people are both providers and consumers), self driving cars (no need for personal auto insurance), internet of things (both a new data source, and a new attack vector), cyber-security (a new form of major risk)
Potential for new structures of insurance (P2P, lowering the barriers of self insurance) — Some startups are trying to reinvent the entire model of insurance and apply new models to the business of insurance.
Key Question
If you are building a startup in the insurance space, a key question you should ask is:
Are you innovating on the sales channel of insurance or are you innovating on the product level (aka. trying to create a next-gen carrier)?
Both are viable but depending on your end goal, you will have very different considerations on how you enter and compete in the market.

They are the only major player in the China insurance space and is the first and only company in China to obtain an Internet insurance license (I believe this is still the case)
In 2015 they wrote $3.6B in policies across 369M customers. They are planning to IPO in 2016.
I hope this landscape sparks a conversation and if you have any feedback feel free to tweet @mccannatron or email me — especially if you feel I am missing any other categories of companies. I’m still learning about the space so would welcome any feedback. I’m also happy to connect with anyone working on a new insurance company — feel free to reach out anytime.

Insurance and Feelings
Aetna is the worst thing I have to worry about.
My desk.
Last week, I learned that Aetna doesn’t fully cover the costs of my therapy, not even half of it really, as Anthem did at my previous employer. Last week, Dawn, one of my excellent coworkers in HR, emailed Aetna on my behalf. Last week, we got a response that I didn’t really like from Aetna. Last week I was, briefly, really annoyed and unhappy with something to do with my job.
In that moment, in the middle of my unhappiness, I smiled as wide as my cheeks would allow at the situation. It struck me that in the 3.5 months I’d been at Slack, this was the first time I’d ever had any reason to be unhappy about something there.
People have asked me what the culture is like, how I feel about it, if I’m happier, and I’ve kept telling them that I’m going to write about it at some point, one day I’ll say how I’m feeling. Until last week, I didn’t have anything concrete to point to, nothing that I thought was enough to properly illustrate how I feel.
#earth-tones
It wouldn’t have been enough to try to describe the elation I felt when I walked in on my first day and immediately felt like I wasn’t alone because there were three other black women in technical roles already there. It wouldn’t have been enough to say that though I was in a new role, using new tools, my coworkers gave me the space and time to learn, letting me get up to speed so I could confidently contribute meaningful stuff. It wouldn’t have been enough to mention the Slack channel dedicated to helping people handle difficult feelings, that is full of warmth, kindness and space to let people have those feelings without being made to feel shameful about them. It wouldn’t have been enough to say that everybody is empathetic and kind to a degree that makes me feel kind like I need to step my humaning skills up just to be on their levels. It wouldn’t have been enough to say that I have never felt more valued and included or less different and isolated anywhere in my life. Those things, while true and meaningful, wouldn’t have been enough to accurately reflect what the past 3.5 months have been like.
Last week, the feeling I got in knowing that the only bit of real unhappiness I’ve had at Slack was to do with insurance, perhaps the most mundane, uninteresting, and unworthy of discussion topic in the history of the world, was complete amusement, and that’s when I knew I couldn’t put off sharing anymore. The world, especially women and/or people of color in tech, had to know that there exists at least one place where the biggest and most pressing source of workplace unhappiness is insurance fuckery.
…even in the rough bits, I still feel like I’m ok to be myself. I still feel like I’m part of the team. I still don’t feel like I’m different. I still feel like I belong.
It hasn’t been all rainbows and sunshine, mind you. There are things that I think could be better. There are no women or people of color on the Slack board and, as far as I can tell, we don’t have any people of color in management, things I feel strongly about. There have been days when I’ve gone into the bathroom to have a quiet moment because I was frustrated with the slow progress I’d been making. Feeling like I’m not contributing doesn’t sit well with me, and learning a slew of new things on top of starting a new role has made contributing difficult. On days when yet another picture of a black body is being shared around the internet, attached to yet another hashtag, I still go hide in the library or an alcove so I can process the emotions I’m feeling. But the thing is, even in those times, even in the rough bits, I still feel like I’m ok to be myself. I still feel like I’m part of the team. I still don’t feel like I’m different. I still feel like I belong.
We’re all in this together.
Stewart has many catch phrases. I won’t rattle them off here because I wouldn’t be able to do them justice, and I’m not really clear on what being the dog means anyway. One though, is pretty demonstrative of what I think makes Slack feel good to me: “We’re all in this together.”
That not-completely-covered-by-Aetna therapy I go to once a week helped me understand myself a lot better, and more importantly, how I tick and what makes me feel happiest: safety and security. My life hasn’t been filled with safety or security, and definitely not both at the same time. Moments when I’ve felt safest and life felt most ok usually preceded really bad times. Maybe this is just Life. At any rate, usually, when I’m happy, part of me is bracing for impact, waiting for the other shoe to drop, for the bad thing to happen so I can deal with it. I don’t feel that at Slack, not even a little bit.
I feel Safe at Slack. Capital S.
I feel Safe at Slack. Capital S. No need to brace for the bad. I don’t worry about any incoming surprises, because I just don’t think they’re coming here. This stems from the “we’re all in this together”-ness that is part of the ethos. Everyone is willing to help everyone. I mean, sure, ask a question, get an answer is pretty standard in most places, but at Slack, you ask the question and the answer doesn’t come with any ego or annoyance. People just help and are happy to, often without your asking for it.
I was recently working on a thing that could have held up my progress and without my even asking for it, my manager asked me if I needed a hand with it. Honestly, I was taken aback at first. Was this his way of telling me I needed to get a move on? Did some plan change that I wasn’t aware of? Turns out neither, he just knew I was at a sticky part and wanted to lend a hand. It’s that sort of thing, not just being a good manager, or teammate, but a good person.
Slack’s Diversity data. Not pictured: Slack’s inclusivity data, which isn’t so easy to capture.
I talk a lot about diversity, but I’m learning that without an environment that encourages being good humans, without leadership that champions empathy, kindness, communication, and compassion, all diversity efforts are for naught. Hire all the “heads of diversity” you want, dump as much money into as many pipeline improvement non-profits as your bank account will allow, but at the end of the day, if you haven’t cultivated a culture that everyone feels welcome and included in, where nobody goes to work wondering which of their coworkers thinks they are lesser than because of their skin color or gender or sexual orientation, where everyone is human first and treats their coworkers that way, your company will see little, if any improvement in those diversity charts, because people can and will leave.
If a company has accepted the importance of a diverse environment, it’s imperative that they also accept that inclusivity is equally important.
This isn’t to minimize the importance of diversity. I’m certain members of a completely homogenous environment could feel very welcomed and included in that space. However, if a company has accepted the importance of a diverse environment, it’s imperative that they also accept that inclusivity is equally important, and inclusivity requires that everyone pay close attention to being good humans to each other. To be sure, though Slack is relatively diverse in comparison to many other Silicon Valley companies, I would not be interested in staying if I didn’t feel like I was in a healthy environment, working with good people.
There’s a lot more to say, but I think that’s really the crux of it: I work with a lot of really good people. Kind, empathetic, helpful people, who are trying their best to be good at humaning, every single day, and believe the effort is worth it. People who will offer to deal with insurance nonsense with me. People who ask each other how they’re feeling each day, and genuinely want to know the answers. People who care as much about each other as they do about the product they’re working on. People who inspire me to be better at my job. People who inspire me to be a better human. I’m grateful for that, I’m grateful for them, I’m grateful that a year ago life kicked me in the ass enough to make the changes I needed to make to be happy…and I am.
Finally.
Erica is human who is also pretty happy outside of work, remains peeved about Aetna’s bullshit, and continues to feel weird about writing about herself in the third person. So weird.

Paul Ryan admitted he has no idea how health insurance works
Ladies and gentlemen, meet the conservative movement’s Great Wonk.
CREDIT: AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite
Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), the Great and Knowledgeable Policy Wonk and Wise Knower of Many Things About Health Care, has no idea how insurance works.
The Great Wonk’s poor grasp of one of the most basic financial instruments was clear after a Power Point presentation he gave Thursday advocating for the House GOP’s embattled health care bill.

The problem with Obamacare, Ryan claimed in this presentation, is that “the young healthy person is going to be made to buy health care and they’re going to pay for the person who gets breast cancer in her 40s or heart disease in their 50s.” He then pointed to a pie chart showing a thin red slice cut into a larger blue pie.
The red slice here are what I would call people with preexisting conditions. People who have real health-care problems. The blue is the rest of the people in the individual market — that’s the market where people don’t get health insurance at their jobs where they buy it themselves. The whole idea of Obamacare is the people on the blue side pay for the people on the red side. The people who are healthy pay for the people who are sick.
Well, yes, that is the whole idea of Obamacare. It’s also the whole idea of any form of insurance of any kind whatsoever.
Think of it this way. Imagine that 1,000 people all buy the same car insurance policy. Over the course of the year, ten of them get in car accidents that cost $10,000 each.
If none of them were insured, the ten unlucky drivers would each be stuck with a $10,000 bill, while the other 990 drivers would pay nothing. The entire point of insurance, however, is to spread this cost around to everyone in the insurance pool. So each driver would instead pay at least $100 in premiums, regardless of whether they were in an accident, and then this money would be redistributed to the ten unlucky individuals with high auto repair bills.
All insurance works this way. Car insurance redistributes wealth from people who aren’t in accidents to people who are. Fire insurance redistributes wealth from people whose houses did not burn down to people whose houses did burn down. Flood insurance redistributes wealth from people who are dry to people whose belongings are soaking wet. And yes, health insurance redistributes wealth from people who are healthy to people who are sick.
The most overrated intellect in Washington
thinkprogress.org
After attacking Obamacare for doing the thing that all insurance, by its very nature, will do, Ryan proposed an alternative to traditional insurance — high-risk pools.
The idea behind high-risk pools is to create a special government program that pays for the most expensive health consumers’ health costs, while leaving other, healthier patients to buy insurance in the private market. That way, healthy individuals still pay for the health care of sick individuals, but they pay for them in higher taxes rather than in higher insurance premiums.
Theoretically, this is a viable policy, but it requires a considerable investment. In 2008, for example, Republican presidential candidate John McCain proposed spending $7 to $10 billion on high-risk pools (the House GOP’s health bill similarly calls for about $10 billion in annual spending on high-risk pools). But this was hardly enough to put a dent in the nation’s uninsurance problem.
As ThinkProgress has previously reported:
A national program “funded at $7 billion per year would cover only 875,000 people,” and that was in 2008. Alternatively, “even if participants had to pay half of their own premiums, as is generally the case today in state high risk pools, less than 2 million Americans would be covered.”
Obamacare, meanwhile, provides health insurance to about 20 million Americans.

What Cancer Can Cost (Even With Insurance)
Our expenses, as heavy as they were, represent a best-case scenario for the costs of cancer.
Photo credit: r. nial bradshaw, CC BY 2.0.
Money was one thing I didn’t worry about when my husband Brad, now 46, asked me if he should get a doctor to check out the weird lumps on his jaw. Don’t get me wrong; I was scared. Those lumps, plus his dramatic weight loss and weird night sweats, sounded to both me and Dr. Google like cancer. But we were financially secure, with savings and good insurance through his job as a university professor. My fears centered on the emotional costs of cancer: the strain on our family, how to tell our two young daughters, the possibility of widowhood.
I was naive about not just how grueling his cancer treatment would be (short answer: very), but also how expensive. Brad’s diagnosis of a rare T-cell lymphoma came in February 2015. The rest of the year was a roller coaster of second opinions, hospitalization, chemotherapy, and relapse. The latter left him only one option: a stem cell transplant (a risky procedure formerly known as a bone marrow transplant), which he underwent in January 2016. His hospital bills skyrocketed into the millions, but insurance covered those; we even had a special liaison at our insurance company who fought for extra coverage for Brad. Our out-of-pocket costs last year were small compared to the bills, but nevertheless mounted into the tens of thousands.
The costs climbed so high because the stem cell transplant saved Brad’s life but nearly killed him first. He came home from the hospital in May blind, immune suppressed, on IV medications, and debilitated from four months in bed. His doctors said he needed someone with him 24 hours a day, and with two children who have to go places, like school, I couldn’t be that person. Insurance won’t cover in-home attendants (though it did cover brief nurse visits for once-a-week skilled tasks like blood draws), so we paid home health attendants for more than two months, until Brad could safely navigate stairs or take a shower unattended. The total cost was $21,807.50.
When Brad left the hospital, the pharmacist handed over a grocery sack of more than 30 medications and a bewildering spreadsheet guide to administering them. Over the year, prescription copays cost $2,013.06. Copays for doctor and dentist visits (including our whole family) came to to $3,146.10. Our monthly insurance premiums were $252.11. (His employer pays much more: $1,727 per month for health insurance alone.)
In the fall, a new cancer interrupted Brad’s recovery. The powerful immune suppressants he took post-transplant caused a different aggressive lymphoma. His oncologist recommended treatment at a clinical trial in New York; we live in California. We bought flights last-minute, in December, and Brad had to stay near a hospital on the Upper East Side, an area where lodging isn’t exactly a bargain. Travel and lodging cost another $9,798.74.
We also incurred miscellaneous expenses like retrofitting our bathroom to accommodate his handicaps ($336), special nutritional supplements ($92 per case, several times), and parking at the hospital ($99 per month). All told, our out-of-pocket medical expenses in 2016 added up to $43,565.82 — more than my annual salary in any of my first three professional jobs. That figure leaves out indirect costs: hiring extra babysitters, helping pay for lodging for his parents (who came from Canada to help), and grocery delivery and laundry service because I was so overextended.
Recently, some friends have asked with concern how the hell we are managing. Brad is a professor, and I am a freelance writer, though I haven’t had time to work much in the past two years. We do have a hidden income source: some family investments I inherited after my mother’s death. Brad’s benefits are generous, and he has received his full pay (his annual salary is $80,000) for nearly two years, thanks to a great deal of accrued sick leave and catastrophic leave donations from his colleagues.
Now, however, he has run out of leave, and he is still too ill to return to work. His university offers early disability retirement with a modest pension, which allows him to retain our health insurance. He also now receives Social Security disability benefits ($1,813 per month), and our daughters receive a child benefit ($453 per month, per child).
Our expenses, as heavy as they were, represent a best-case scenario for the costs of cancer. We got off easy — and so did our insurer. Brad’s hospital bills in 2016 totaled more than $7 million; the first explanation of benefits (EOB) I opened, one exhausted day when I came home from the hospital, was for $3,922,498.67. (A significant chunk of that was labeled “room and board;” since my husband’s condition rendered him unable to eat for months, I felt like he should have gotten a discount on the board.) Other EOBs rolled in, sporting figures like $787,929.61; $1,085,933.82; and $1,091,127.76. Last year we received 209 EOBs — more than one every other day.
Our share of all those billed costs for my husband’s four-month-long hospitalization was a cool $0. Of course, our insurer paid only a fraction of those figures. Negotiated discount rates for big carriers shift high costs onto the uninsured and marginally insured, bankrupting them in droves. Had we not had insurance, all those bills would have come straight to us, and even liquidating all our assets would not have begun to cover them.
Before the stem cell transplant, I feared that the costs Brad had already incurred might put him close to a lifetime limit on coverage. I frantically pored over our insurance policy, wondering if we should be equally frantically saving more. Like many Americans, I was at the time unaware that the Affordable Care Act — now under threat of repeal — had banned such coverage caps, as one of the protections it extended to people with employer-provided insurance plans. Before the ACA’s passage, close to 60 percent of such plans had coverage caps — many as low as $2 million in lifetime costs. Imagine having a premature baby who exceeds her lifetime-coverage quota before ever leaving the NICU, or undergoing grueling cancer treatment for years and surviving, only to be denied coverage when the insurer has spent what it deems enough.
Politicians aiming to repeal the ACA speak of personal responsibility, saying Americans should save more for health-care costs. But personal responsibility alone is insufficient for such devastating diseases as cancer. The idea that most Americans could fund a health savings account — as suggested by those who would repeal the ACA — enough to cover even a minor medical emergency, let alone an ongoing health crisis or chronic illness, is cruelly nonsensical.
Out-of-pocket costs gave my husband’s and my personal responsibility an expensive workout in 2016. We are extraordinarily fortunate that we could sort of afford it. We felt the pinch but kept our house, and — unlike some of our friends who have endured cancer treatment — we didn’t have to declare bankruptcy. Unlike many whom ACA repeal threatens, we can keep our insurance, and for that we are thankful. Brad is currently in remission, recovering slowly at home from his long ordeal, and our expenses so far this year are lighter. But if we’ve learned anything from my husband’s long illness, it is that cancer is unpredictable — and so are medical expenses.

This Insurance Startup Wants to Cover Tomorrow’s Self-Driving Cars
For now, penny-pinching Tesla owners will get a discount when they use Autopilot.

When Joshua Brown drove his Tesla last May into a truck making a turn — or, depending on how you view it, when the Tesla drove itself into a truck while Joshua Brown was behind the wheel — the fatal accident triggered a crisis for Elon Musk’s electric car company. Was its hands-off Autopilot feature, despite caveats that a driver’s hands should be ready to grab control in a split second, inherently unsafe? Did its auto-braking system fail? The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched a seven-month investigation. Early this year, it concluded: “A safety-related defect trend has not been identified at this time and further examination of this issue does not appear to be warranted.” Though the agency cautioned that its investigation did not preclude the possibility that the system has a safety-related defect, Tesla felt vindicated.
Now an auto insurance startup called Root is taking that conclusion to the bank, so to speak. It believes that the investigation, as well as its own studies on the matter, make a strong case that Teslas with Autopilot are safer than just plain humans. So confident is Root about this that, starting today, it is charging Tesla drivers lower fees if they turn on and use the controversial Autopilot feature.

“When we believe that a car is in autonomous mode, we apply a discount to those miles,” says Root CEO Alex Timm. “It’s a pretty significant amount of premium — a little above 10 percent for now.” The discounts get higher as the percentage of highway miles driven increases.
Some people might find this discount surprising considering recent reports (including one we ran on Backchannel just last week) that Autopilot is somewhat of a work in progress. But Timm agrees with Tesla that the driving-assist system, even as Tesla keeps improving it, is superior to a plain old human driving the vehicle. “We believe that these cars are definitively safer,” says Timm.
Root was particularly impressed at the NHTSA report’s finding that after Tesla drivers installed Autosteer, a key component of the Autopilot systems, the crash rate dropped by almost 40 percent. “That really got our attention, so we started to look into it,” says Timm. Root tested the cars, and bought one itself. And now Root is exercising its actuarial mojo by betting that it will pay out fewer dollars in claims to Telsa owners who turn over some of their duties to Elon Musk’s software.

The Tesla discount is a natural outgrowth of Root’s business model, which is based on using technology to identify safe drivers and offer them low rates. If you suck at driving, you don’t get a policy. Before getting coverage, customers must submit to a two-to-three-week testing period, downloading the Root app to their phones, which will use the sensors in the device to track location, speed, acceleration, and whether they are weaving recklessly between lanes at 2 a.m. after leaving a taproom. Or whether they are using the actual phone measuring their driving skills to text while in motion. This actually happens, says Timm, because after a few days drivers forget that they are being monitored and revert to bad habits.
(c/o Root)
According to Timm, about 70 percent of those who undergo this process will be deemed safe drivers, whereupon the company will offer them a low rate, with the entire transaction done on the phone. (Even your proof-of-insurance card will be stored on the device.) The other 30 percent have to get insurance from Root’s competitors. No matter how miserable a driver you are, Root will not report you to the authorities, though if it’s clear you pose a menace, the company will send a gentle email broaching the subject. Timm says it goes something along the lines of, “Things aren’t looking so well…You really should rethink some of these things.” Those emails aren’t always well received. “A lot of people don’t want to be coached at all on their driving behavior, because everybody thinks they’re a good driver.”
That mentality used to be a big problem for auto insurers. But we are at the cusp of an era in which everybody’s record will become pristine, because when all cars drive themselves, everyone will be a superb driver. One might think this will be a boon for insurers, who will see claims drop dramatically. Timm argues otherwise: The paucity of accidents and claims will drop the real cost of insurance so low that the established companies, stuck with high overheads, won’t be able to cut their prices enough. They will thus be subject to Uber-level disruption from newcomers who will be able to charge fees as low as $30 every six months.
Root views itself as one of those newcomers, a “next-gen” insurer that will take advantage of this paradigm shift. Timm himself is kind of an insurance nerd who began in the business at age 14. “Let’s say I was not a normal kid,” he admits. Now 28, he started Root in 2014 after working as an actuary for Nationwide. Last October, Root began selling policies; Timm won’t divulge figures but reports steady growth. Eventually, he hopes to topple his former employer and its fellow dinosaurs as the very essence of auto insurance changes.
“Those other carriers will have a significant problem because they’re not set up to understand the data,” he says. “And their expense structures will start to crush them.”

Root has not contacted Tesla directly, but says that even without the car manufacturer’s help, the Root app can figure out when a Tesla owner is using Autopilot. Timm hopes that in the future, the company can work directly with Tesla to get better data. That may well happen. Though Tesla would not put an executive on the record to talk about the the issue, it gave a statement saying that it “will consider how it can best ensure that insurance agencies understand the safety benefits to customers from using Autopilot.” In an earnings call recently, Musk indicated he’s open to sharing aggregate data with government agencies and other manufacturers. Presumably, he’d have no problem if owners voluntarily opted in to sharing their personal driving data, in order to get lower rates.
All of that data sharing, of course, opens up a lot of privacy issues. Root says that it doesn’t track drivers once they clear the bar for coverage. But he does believe that ultimately every auto insurance company will want to measure a driver’s performance before insuring him or her. And who’s to say that eventually the standard won’t be moved to constant, real-time monitoring?
(c/o Root)
In any case, Root’s announcement is a high-profile way to grab the lead in the as-yet-undeclared competition to insure drivers who aren’t driving. Of course, the actuary in Alex Timm understands that there’s some risk involved. Though Timm is a huge fan of Tesla’s Autopilot feature — “When you experience it you absolutely know it’s the future,” he says — he has also lived through that Autopilot moment when you think, Uh-oh, it’s time to grab the wheel. He admits that gave him pause. But ultimately he concluded that “it takes a bit more risk to be a bit more forward-thinking.” And he feels confident that Tesla has managed the risk in a way that makes the cars safer.
Of course, by rolling out its self-driving discount at this early stage of its business, Root itself is managing risk. Though the company is in the process of getting licensed in 12 new states, it currently covers customers only in its home state of Ohio. How many Teslas owners can there possibly be in Ohio?
The only one I’ve heard of is the late Joshua Brown. Though the 40-year-old Tesla driver met his fate on a Florida road, he was registered in Canton.

The Secret Behind Lemonade’s Instant Insurance
Introducing AI Jim, the Lemonade claims bot
Hey everyone. It’s been almost a month since my last update where we exposed the metrics from Lemonade’s first 48 hours. Today, I wanted to let you in on some of the secret stuff that drives our unique claims experience.
I couldn’t have asked for a better setting for writing this post — here in this gorgeous countryside village, on the outskirts of Lisbon, where once a year, a bunch of techies get together for a few days of talk about Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Healthcare and Autonomous Everything. Big things are coming, and I’m super excited to see Lemonade a part of it.
Enjoying Mixed Reality with Robert Scoble and Paddy Cosgrave
Alright, I could go on about this forever, but we have things to discuss.
A well hidden secret
When we started mapping everything that we thought was broken in the old insurance world, one thing kept coming up: just how poor the claims experience was. People told us they sometimes had to wait months before having their claims paid, not to mention the hassle and paperwork involved.
There are many reasons why insurance companies find it difficult to provide a good claims service. First, insurance companies are run by people, tens of thousands of them, doing manual labor, filling out forms, faxing stuff and calling phones. These operations take time. Just think about those claims piling up on someone’s desk…
But there’s another, less obvious reason. One that insurance companies feel bad admitting even exists.
The secret insurance companies don’t want us to know: the less they pay out for claims, the richer they become.
You see, that guy who’s responsible for your claim could be an honest fella. I bet he is. But it doesn’t matter because the system he works for is designed to maximize profits, so he and his coworkers are under constant pressure to cut costs and meet their targets. But in the claims world, cutting costs often means paying you less, or not at all.
This was our Aha! moment. If we could figure out how to take away the underlying incentives that drive insurance companies to behave the way they do, we’d have a shot at profoundly changing how insurance works.
We realized that to build a system that is clean from bureaucracy, manual processes and distrust, we would have to remove the temptation of maximizing profits by never keeping unclaimed premiums to ourselves.
Instead of feeding from premium leftovers, we only take a 20% flat fee off the top. The rest goes to stuff like reinsurance, surplus, taxes, claims and our famous Giveback. This way, regardless of the amount we pay out in claims, we end up with the same bottom line.
This changes everything.
Now, there’s no more pressure to hold back on payments, and no incentives that work against our customers. Check out what Jim, who leads claims at Lemonade, wrote about how we’re revolutionizing the way claims are handled.
Btw, if you’re asking yourself — what happens when money runs out, it’s the same as in any other insurance company. We’re reinsured by the biggest names in the industry, including Lloyd’s.
This is something (the real) Jim wrote on our office window, to remind himself of our unconventional values
So we no longer treat our users’ leftover premium money as our potential revenue because we give it back anyway. And because it’s not ours and we’re giving it back — we can delight our customers by doing everything painfully simple and super fast.
We designed Lemonade to be instant. Buying a policy, filing a claim or switching from a previous insurer shouldn’t take more than seconds.
Self-Served Claims
The part of our product that got the most attention was the claims system. After looking at commercial insurance software it was clear that we needed something completely different.
Put simple, we needed a bot version of Jim, so our customers could enjoy his charming personality and kickass claims handling, 24/7 365.
Chatting with AI Jim while filing a claim in the Lemonade app
Our team spent months learning how claims are handled by humans in old insurance companies. We then used this knowledge to craft an instant claims experience for our claims bot — AI Jim. The algorithms powering AI Jim ‘understand’ the nature of claims, their severity, and whether the user is in a state of emergency. AI Jim also tries to assess the likelihood of a claim being fraudulent and even nudges people to be more honest by incorporating years of behavioral economics research into every little detail in the conversation and the UI.
Jim’s AI tracks loads of user-generated data-points to help us identify suspicious activity and predict what our customers need before they even know it. In the first month or so, our system tracked 3.7 million signals.
But as we often experience from the likes of Siri, as smart as algorithms may be, they aren’t always perfect. This is why we only use our claim algorithms to help us reach one single decision: should a claim be handled automatically or not. AI Jim will either pay claims instantly or call in the human Jim to take charge.

Setting expectations
Having AI and a good infrastructure doesn’t mean that we’ll blindly and automatically pay every claim we get. Insurance is a regulated business, and even if we wanted to, paying every claim will put us and our reinsurers out of business quickly.
So, setting expectations is very important, and is something we’ll be working on improving constantly. Our policy forms are still based on the regulatory approved format, and they’re lame, we know ;)
Here’s an example of a claim we will not cover: Our policy clearly states that there are certain breeds of dogs that will not be covered if they attack someone and that someone gets injured. If a person ignores this and his Pitbull Terrier (one of the non-covered vicious dogs) bites Newman the Mailman, we will not be able to help.
It’s still too early to share stats about our claims activity (there isn’t much to share), but I promise to do so as we continue to gather interesting insight about damages, claims and everything that’s in between.
In the meantime, stay safe and check out Lemonade.com

Risk & Reward: Opportunities in Insurance
We take it for granted, but insurance is an incredible financial instrument for consumers and businesses: give a small and steady stream of payments today to avoid getting stuck with catastrophic payment(s) in the future. Whether medical, automotive, life, residential, or commercial, the value proposition of smoothing out potential cash flow outlays often makes sense. Pretty cool. But on any chart highlighting relative customer satisfaction across industries, you will consistently find that insurance ranks among the last — only ahead of real estate, telcos and cable companies.
Source: Satisfaction Survey — BCG / Morgan Stanley: “Insurance Technology Evolution and Revolution”
At a time when nearly every product category has been reimagined by a higher quality digital successor — the insurance industry and customer have been left in the dust. But the amount of chatter and activity surrounding insurance in the venture world is growing. This is great news for consumers and businesses, and troubling for flat-flooted incumbents. To highlight just a few interesting signals from the market:
Insurance firms with corporate venture arms are signaling need for innovation within their model. Axa, Assurant, Munich Re, and AmFam are just a few examples of firms opting to learn and participate in the disruption as opposed to sitting on the sidelines.
We now have a few proof points in the industry. Instead of delivering software tools and analytics to enhance the legacy value chain, businesses like GC-backed Oscar and SF startup Clover Health have decided to wipe the slate clean and start fresh. The industry is that broken.
Friends at other venture firms are talking about the emerging opportunities. Brendan Dickinson at Canaan drew parallels to the explosion in recent non-bank lending investing activity and the opportunity to overcome what previously seemed like insurmountable regulatory barriers. Frank Chen at Andreessen highlighted new applications for software across the value chain — from pricing risk to engaging customers and pooling capital. And Lee Hower of NextView ventures called out the startling innovation gap between most developed countries (where 40–50% of insurance is bought or managed over the internet) versus the U.S. (with less than 5% online).
Venture money is now going into the industry, where it used to be barren. Aggregate VC funding in insurance over the past 5 years tops $2B, but was already at ~$800M in just the first half of 2015 alone.
VC Financing Trends in Insurance (2010–2015YTD)
SO, WHAT GIVES?
The venture world is always in search for the next big market opportunity, of which insurance is certainly one. Insurance represents more than $1.3T in premiums in the U.S. alone. That’s bigger than the the amount of money spent annually on online travel (~$160B) + household work (~$460B) + food delivery (~$600B) — combined.
The industry is also really old. There are 46 insurance companies in the Fortune 500, with an average age of around 95 years. We’re talking pre-internet, and it shows. The industry’s entire organizational structure was designed for an antiquated, Mad Men era buying experience.
And, these incumbents are pervasive. Collectively, insurance companies employ more than 2m people and spend billions of dollars annually on marketing. You can’t watch an hour of television without getting interrupted by a little lizard, caveman in tennis whites, or quacking duck. It’s everywhere.

But the customer experience with these companies — whether in life, home/renters, or commercial — has largely stayed the same. Insurance has been insulated from the disruption impacting other sectors like travel, due to complex regulatory requirements, inherent channel conflict between carriers & brokers, and the opaque nature of data used to assess risk. Like so many other industries, it’s time to move on — and to accept the opportunities, unknowns, and challenges that come with a scaled digital population.
WHY NOW?
Timing is everything and the industry is finally on the brink of transformative change, driven by strong secular trends. The world is online and connected — creating new distribution channels but also new risk (e.g., cybersecurity). Additionally, explosion of the shared economy and 1099 workers has created fractional ownership — and with it, uncertainty around who bears the risk.
And in that digital world, we generate digital exhaust, which can be used to better personalize policies and underwrite risk. Increasingly, consumers are wearing FitBits to track wellness data, installing Canary for home security, or sharing lifestyle behavior on social media. Imagine tracking your driving data in real-time, making dynamic changes to policy premiums, and receiving an instant claim reimbursement for that fender bender — all with just a few taps on your mobile phone.
Crucially, the regulatory climate is also changing. Historically, success has required huge capital reserves as well as navigating 50 state-by-state regulators with unique laws around underwriting, pricing and distribution. This structure has stalled innovation, protected incumbents and imposed tremendous costs. Now, Washington is beginning to call for more simple and consistent requirements across state and federal levels. Emerging structures have the potential to lower capital reserve hurdles or change the way capital is pooled. And the U.S. insurance industry is facing increasing pressure to adopt international regulatory standards that encourage consumer protection and price transparency. All of these policies should lower barriers to entry, level the playing field and create opportunities for new entrants to innovate.
The world is changing. If you look at Oscar, SoFi, Lending Club, these are categories of financial services that nobody thought would be reinvented by a startup. But we live in a post-2008 financial crisis, JOBS act, and peer-to-peer lending world. Now, more than ever before, entrepreneurs are ready and able to take on the Mega Fortune 500 companies.
WHAT’S NEXT?
Despite the complexity of products, the insurance business model is rather simple, relying on policy premium income and asset management. I’m focused here on the operating side of insurance, and see opportunities for innovation across the value chain. Importantly, while each step of the value chain is consistent across the industry (as outlined below), the ability to fundamentally change process and drive margin will vary wildly by insurance vertical (e.g., life, auto, health).

I’m focused on 3 investment theses that I’ll dig into deeper in subsequent posts.
Online Aggregators & Brokers. The first mirrors GC’s experience with Kayak and trying to bring best of breed user experience to online aggregation / shopping. Through smart user experience, information transparency, and digital concierge-like services — it’s possible to make informed decisions (that once seemed so complicated they required a human) and fully transact online. Success of companies like Check24 in Germany highlight how far behind the U.S. is, and underscore the size of the opportunity.
New Direct to Consumer Brands. The second leverages GC’s experience building DTC brands, such as Warby Parker and Oscar. Fully digital players in Homeowners/Renters and Life Insurance will increasingly displace existing carriers, by re-positioning products and engaging consumers directly.
New Models. I’ll challenge some of the fundamental assumptions we’ve made about types of products that require coverage and how business models are structured. Drawing from experience with transformative models like Digit, FundBox, and RealtyShares, I’ll explore models like peer-to-peer (e.g., Guevara) and pay-as-you-go (e.g., MetroMile) that are more nimble and flexible.
It has been exciting to see the energy that’s being poured into the insurance sector from engineers, data scientists, and early stage investors. GC has been active in the space for a couple of years, leading early investments in Oscar (health insurance), Censio (driver analytics for improved underwriting), and Super (home warrantee). As I look at GC’s work with next generation DTC brands (Warby Parker, Honest Co) and disruptive financial services (FundBox, Stripe, RealtyShares), I’m confident that entrepreneurs can deliver new levels of service and transparency in insurance. I’m excited to make a number of more bets in the category — and even more excited for the value to be unlocked in the ecosystem.
Thanks to Whitney Arthofer, Prateek Alsi, and Molly Gillis for your help exploring this space and with this post.

Insurance, The Blockchain, and The Sharing Economy:
Re-Imagining InsurTech with P2P Social Insurance Networks on the Blockchain
I never thought I would ever write a paper about Insurance, but it recently came up as an interest of mine, as I’ve found that the most interested, and interesting parties, in the blockchain ecosystem are the innovators in the Insurance industry. This is my take, musing if you will, on how Insurance companies can easily approach innovating in their industry with some exceptionally smart founders who are very willing to collaborate with the industry titans to solve some of the most interesting problems facing the developed and developing world.
This article will explore how individuals, entrepreneurs, and insurance companies can come together to create new and innovative insurance models to drive customer adoption and satisfaction, as well as address the needs of the underinsured and uninsured in the developed and developing world through Blockchain enabled Peer-to-Peer transactional social insurance networks.
I will investigate new ways of looking at insurance, risk, and social networks, as well as how the blockchain, prediction markets, decentralized autonomous organizations, and smart contracts can fundamentally unlock the commercial scale and social power of “the sharing economy” to exponentially drive innovation in the insurance industry.

We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other’s happiness — not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way
— Charlie Chaplin, the Great Dictator
Insurance Origins
“Friendly Societies” or “Collaborative Communities” was the original model of the insurance business. However, the modern problems associated with the insurance business can be somewhat attributed to corporate centralization, state controls, and constrictive policy decisions.
Essentially, the development of the modern business of insurance started, and is largely dependant on a “hedge” or bet against risks, especially regarding cargo, property, death, automobile accidents, and medical treatment, which can be attributed, historically, to “Mutuals” which were formed by firefighters, farmers and other groups to share in their losses and gains. The early peer to peer nature of industry helped to eliminate risk, and spread said risk from the individual to the larger community. This provided an important source of long-term finance for both the public and private sectors. [01]
Before the development of large-scale government, employer health insurance programs, and other financial services, friendly societies played an important part in many people’s lives. Many of these societies still exist. In some countries, some of them developed into large mutually run financial institutions, typically insurance companies, and lost any social and ceremonial aspect they may have had; in others incarnations, they continue to have a role based on solidarity and democracy without an objective to make profit.
Take for example the early cases of medical insurance, especially in America, members typically paid regular membership fees and went to lodge meetings to take part in ceremonies. If members became sick, they would receive an allowance to help them meet their financial obligations. Typically in member/friendly societies, members of the group would visit sick peers to give emotional and other support, and possibly to verify that the sick member was not malingering, “Malingering” is fabricating or exaggerating the symptoms of mental or physical disorders for a variety of “secondary gain” motives, which may include financial compensation (often tied to fraud)[02].
Eventually, The shift away from the decentralized nature of insurance — to a system of paying for a company to take on that risk — had resulted in expensive premiums, fraud, incomplete information on policyholders, and the moral hazards of coverage.
I would propose that by going back to the roots of insurance, coupled with a few modern technology networks and protocols namely; the internet, social networks and the blockchain, We can provide an new approach to an old world system that will mitigate risks, reduce costs, and ultimately provide better service to a broader range of people worldwide. The peer group, enabled by the internet, social networks, and the blockchain can self insure to a point and partner with either an insurance carrier or reinsurance organization to deal with almost any type of insurance from the simple protection of valuables to really catastrophic and unexpected losses.
The Sharing Economy
It can be argued that the most valuable companies, and fastest growing of recent time, can be attributed to a group of startups that primarily focused on monetizing unused or underused inventory leveraged through online networks. By creating a marketplace and the ability to discover these unseen “assets” companies like AirBnB, Lyft, and Uber have dramatically reshaped the landscapes of their respective industries, creating a new category called the “Sharing Economy”.
The Sharing economy refers to peer-to-peer-based sharing of access to goods and services (coordinated through community-based online services).[1] Sharing economy can take a variety of forms, including using information technology to provide individuals, corporations, non-profits and governments with information that enables the optimization of resources[2] through the redistribution, sharing and reuse of excess capacity in goods and services.[2][1][3] A common premise is that when information about goods is shared (typically via an online marketplace), the value of those goods may increase for the business, for individuals, for the community and for society in general.[***]
Collaborative consumption as a phenomenon is a class of economic arrangements in which participants share access to products or services, rather than having individual ownership.[03]
The concept of the sharing economy applied to insurance, can be a relevant premise, provided that it can deliver greater value to consumers while at the same time enabling large insurance companies to transform, sustainably to market transitions, and or enable themselves to participate in said market transformation, while at the same time opening themselves up to new, and/or previously unviable markets, through the scale of the system.
The value of P2P social insurance networks enabled by the blockchain is that it can draw on the benefits of decentralization, prediction markets, decentralized autonomous corporations, social networks and traditional insurance to create a superior product, by streamlining information, accessing underserved markets — viably, more accurately assess risk, as it can be market driven, and through dramatic cost reductions.
With more than seven billion people living in the world today, we’re realizing the importance and benefits of sharing. While most of the applications available now are fueling the shared economy, many of them use some sort of middleman. The inherent nature of the blockchain is that it allows people to manage and share their wealth without any intermediaries, with greater transparency, transnationally, and with market and network consensus on truth. This translates, simply, to efficiency, trust, and risk mitigated cost for both individuals and organizations.
Through social networks and decentralized autonomous corporations/organizations, a known, or unknown group of people, organized by interest or demographics can select its own members without being regulated by government bodies that have restrictive legislation; can then invite only those individuals who are more likely to be better risks because they are generally known — either in person or through social networks — to other members of the group.
This screening can prevent more risky participants to join the peer group and hence reduce the frequency and severity of events or claims eg. If the costs for everyone else in the group depend in part on one’s behavior, the group has an incentive to encourage one to act in a way that reduces the likelihood that any of us have a claim, when a lot of groups aren’t filing claims, that lowers the cost to all purchasing insurance.[04] Moreover, it’s not just policyholders who are benefiting from the social insurance model. Insurance companies stand to benefit as well.
I propose that under a P2P model, Insurance companies can expect happier, more loyal, and more engaged pool of customers, because they’re partaking in a more pleasurable user/customer experience, as the platform/marketplace is dis-intermediated, thus reducing the onerous task of acquiring insurance, as well as realizing tangible savings. This can only invariably lead to high overhead costs, particularly on fraudulent and small claims, shrink, while driving scale.
P2P Insurance
Innovators the world over are looking at ways to leverage the power of your social networks, and increasingly now the Blockchain, to reduce and distribute costs, provide more accurate, albeit market driven risk mitigation, while at the same time bypassing onerous regulatory impediments.
In today’s peer-to-peer models, insurance policyholders form small groups online. A part of the insurance premiums paid, flow into a group fund, the other part to the insurer. Minor damages to the insured policyholder are firstly paid out of this group fund. For claims above the deductible limit the regular insurer is called upon. When there is no insurance claim, the policyholder gets his/her share refunded from the group pool, or credited towards the next policy year. If the group pool happens to be empty, a special insurance comes into force[05]
A group can be set up by the policyholders, forming an “social insurance network”. The only requirement is that all group members must have the same type of insurance. Examples are liability insurance, household contents insurance, legal expenses insurance and electronics insurance. The peer-to-peer insurance concept carries no costs other than the special insurance. The providers are financed through brokerage commissions of insurance, in this case through a decentralized autonomous corporation existing within the blockchain.
Insurance rates are determined by how risky insurance companies think it is to cover you, or in tandem with what a second group of peers “predict” or assess your risk is based on thier based mostly on demographics, location, lifestyle and history. (More on this below in Prediction Markets). The fewer claims your group has, the less money you’ll spend with peer-to-peer insurance.
The goal of social insurance, in the context that I’m proposing, is to give people more control over potential insurance costs, arrive at a market derived risk assessment through prediction markets, cover deductibles, encourage safe behavior, lower rates and administrative costs, while at the same time by-passing staid regulation. The natural fit for this model is to utilize aspects of the blockchain, that can reduce friction in the transaction process, while providing a higher degree of information flow and market dynamics to drive out costs and promote adoption.
The Blockchain and Insurance
As I mentioned above, exploring how blockchain technology can interact with insurance, has become an endeavor that has led me to talk to many industry professionals, as well as entrepreneurs looking at possible implications in terms of the relationship between individuals, insurance and insurers; and current perspectives on the relevance and potential of blockchain technology. I have tried to distill as many concepts, or at the least the core elements here to describe, the discussions, however i would disclose that my views are skewed towards the challenger, with hopes that collaboration can create shared value for both the incumbent and challenger, but with aims to provide insurance products to markets that have been historically underserved — primarily the underinsured and uninsured.
Blockchain technology’s main innovation is an electronic public transaction record of integrity without central authority. Beside cryptocurrencies and distributed payment systems, blockchain applications could include areas of finance where a central, trusted third party has traditionally been used eg. escrow accounts, trade finance, and in this case insurance.
Blockchains can contain set of documents, record assets and help to manage interconnected devices. Emerging applications, such as smart contracts and decentralised autonomous organisations, might in future also permit blockchains to act as automated agents.[05]
Blockchain technology has the ability to transform the very way people engage and conduct finance, and close the gap, or make irrelevant the divide between global and local in payment and processing times; influence consumer perception of value added services; drive honesty and transparency; and, influence consumer perceptions of risk that could change the way insurers support mutualisation.
Non-insurers are more likely to be the first to create insurance or insurance-related applications. As we see with the innovative startups “Guevara”, and “Friendsurance”. However, I believe that companies of this nature can go even further, if enabled by Blockchain applications, and I expect to see more experimental startups add in enhancements to thier platforms that are likely to start with self sovereign digital identity systems, proof of existence functions and zero knowledge proofs to manage personal property and data.
Emerging Blockchains and Applications
Blockchain technology has the potential to enhance and create transformative financial services applications, including insurance. Through distributed applications hosted on decentralised platforms, such as: Bitcoin, the first blockchain protocol released in 2009; Ethereum, an open platform which could host distributed applications, namely smart contracts; “Bitshares” which boasts transaction speeds approaching Nasdaq; Eris, an Ethereum “Fork” and blockchain-manufacturing and management toolkit; or the much anticipated “Rootstock”, a smart-contract peer-to-peer platform built on top of the Bitcoin Blockchain, a more recent project which aims to provide Ethereum capabilities on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.
I’m eager to see how companies can support the automation of insurance products based on betting- like insurance products and financial derivative contracts.eg utilizing a platfom like Augur to integrate prediction markets into thier transacation process (more on this below)
Moreover, blockchain technology and distributed applications open up the range of assets and information that can be managed and stored on and from the blockchain, some of which can be relevant to insurance.
Interesting models include applications to create or store genetic and medical record data using for example Genecoin, which allows individuals to securely back up their own DNA by recording it on the blockchain or, DNA.Bits which aims to provide access to large samples of anonymised medical records and genetic data through the blockchain.[06]
Third, new insurance solutions could emerge to handle risks arising from blockchain technology usage (e.g. account hacking on exchange where individuals can buy AltCoins to participate on a blockchain), digital asset protection or even in relation to the security of Internet of Things solutions, depending on demand (i.e. the extent to which individuals want to outsource emerging risks to third party providers) and feasibility.[07]
Self Sovereign Identity
Blockchain technology and related applications can transform the way insurance companies manage and facilitate digital identity (ID), personal information and history. An ID scheme relying on a decentralised blockchain combining a public ledger of records with an adequate attestment and zero knowledge proofs, as I mentioned in a previous post could rival state-backed identity (which is generally checked against other databases, uses biometric data and is backed by law) in terms of security through decentralisation and cryptography.[08]
A number of digital ID schemes are emerging, including ONENAME, and OpenID Connect, a protocol combining an identity layer and an authorisation server, which allows clients of all types (e.g. developers) to request and receive information about authenticated session and end-users across websites and apps without having to own or manage password files.[09]
Creating a self sovereign digital ID that is trusted and can be used widely, In practice, would be a blockchain-based identity scheme that could take the form of a distributed application hosted on a blockchain protocol which could use arbitrators i.e. pre-determined experts authenticating documents or information submitted) or oracles allowed to cross-reference information securely with other data sources, including government attested documents
The application could enable additional functions including personal data storage, authorised access frameworks for external providers or even reputation ratings, most probably through connected social media, or transaction history etc..
Combining authentication and personal data management functionalities with decentralised and secure blockchains could lead to new frameworks for identity management.
In insurance, the streamlining of digital authentication and better management of personal data and history disclosure could translate into more direct and efficient relationships between insurance companies and individuals.[10]
Market Scale and Reach
Blockchains are distributed across networks of computers, themselves distributed across space. Blockchain technology has the potential to shape different interactions between individuals and places, further blurring the divide between local and global.[11]
Blockchain technology and related applications can be global in scope and in scale as to some extent the only requirement from a user perspective is to have a computer, smartphone an Internet, or wifi connection.
This scale and potential access to underserved regions of the world could support the tailoring of insurance products that are specifically designed where there is not sufficiently strong market demand (historically for legacy system) or enough quality data (e.g. creditworthiness).[12]
Where this can be directly applicable is Microinsurance, which is insurance characterized by small premiums and claim amounts, is an important risk management tool for the unbanked and uninsured in emerging markets around the world. Billions of individuals around the world do not have access to basic financial services such as banking and insurance. Access to this market has been hindered primarily by transaction costs and lack of verifiable and credible identification.Moreover, given my inclination to disruptive innovation, this falls directly in line with the now common understanding of a valuable form of innovation that incumbents should surely watch out for. The Notion that people can contract with each other round the globe using robust technology. More material in that people can handily set up local insurance vehicles easily. The mid-ground might be many local vehicles sharing global reserving or reinsuring facilities.
Widely distributed social insurance platforms, provided they get the scale and breakout velocity they need to reach these underserved markets could also see blockchain-based risk management models emerge, if not intended, including self-managed or administered risk protocols, peer-to-peer insurance platforms and even fully funded solutions. Over time disintermediation could take place as a result of automation, particularly for well known and perhaps more common risks.
Blockchain technology could support the rise of peer-to-peer insurance platforms and thus contribute to enabling self- and mutual- risk management frameworks. Distributed mutualisation combined with the ‘wisdom of crowds’ could support efficient claim management and fraud reduction.Further, such insurance mini- mutuals might increase the need and spread but perhaps reduce the size of typical reinsurance. Blockchain-based solutions could help to automate and achieve efficiency gains by using smart contracts, which in turn could lead to self-administration of certain insurance products, such as betting-like insurance products or hedging mechanisms (e.g. prediction markets). [13]
This is not a likely scenario in the near-term, but one could imagine a DAO contained in a completely automated blockchain. Customers would no longer rely on intermediaries, rather wholly on the technology and its persistence. Where the blockchain provides a platform for participants to take on pre-determined risk and manage it, possibly in conjunction with expert advice. As a result, in such instances, insurance companies’ role is likely to evolve from that of risk handlers to one of risk management advisors.[14]
As a result, the technology and its applications could eventually contribute to changing the role and function of insurers in society. Blockchain technology and distributed applications could for example support access to affordable and quality insurance products through distributed micro-insurance solutions combined with mobile technologies; or, by extending insurance product coverage to previously excluded populations, provided that adequate identity and information management functionalities (e.g. notary or personal data management function) are in place.[15]
Taking the concept of decentralised blockchain operated platforms further could lead to the emergence of decentralised marketplaces where insurance companies compete to meet the needs and requirements of clients or groups of clients whether in terms of insurance products or risk management expertise and advice.
Should this materialise at scale, the shift in insurers’ role from risk handler to expert advice and knowledge provider in relation to direct risk management (including preventive measures) is likely to be reinforced.[16]
Innovation and the Battle for the Future
Incumbents, or those in the industry that have come to sustain their lives and or business from the existing state of being, and the challengers who provoke thought and change within the landscape; think of the blockchain technology and related applications as something that could radically change the nature and scope of the insurance industry. While Incumbents are skeptical, yet curious, they lack the courage to make the required experiments that will provide the necessary transformation that will provide “competitive sustainability”. Challengers on the other hand, see the blockchain and the insurance landscape as fertile ground to experiment with new models, and revolutionary missions, that change the very notion of what insurance is, and can be, for a wider group of people around the world. Through disintermediation of the industry, the emergence of new actors, primarily small, innovative entrepreneurs, technologists, and startups are investigating distributed peer-to-peer insurance platforms, encouraging and empowering the self-management of; self-sovereign identity, risk verification, social networks, and collaborative consumption, thus contributing to changing the role of insurers to an actor in an ecosystem, as opposed to the centralizing force that controls and shapes the market.
For innovators, either in startups or incumbent companies, the blockchain is an exciting and positive development, however for those who do not understand the truly transformational potential of this technology, and the platform for creativity that can bare to be, it is a dangerous technology which will incur unintended consequences, mostly perceived as detrimental to the status quo.
Change is inevitable, in what incarnation that brings is unknown at this time, however, we know that it will radically change the notion of what insurance is, how it is delivered, and who it is delivered to, and under what circumstances. The landscape of the industry will change with the onset of blockchain technology, but in what form, will largely be determined by those innovators who successfully experiment with the technology and what their ideological perspective is, in deploying the technology to achieve their objectives. When the blockchain takes hold of the Insurance industry, and related applications emerge within markets known, and to be revealed; this will fundamentally change and open the market(s) to new third party providers/constituents other than insurers. The most likely, under the model I’m porposing, is crowds acting as markets that will shape the nature of the services and products. Some degree of centralisation is likely to stay, however, I believe that “swarms” or decentralized groups aggregating in collaboration, will most likely replace the centralizing economies of scale that have been the predominant nature of the industry up until this day. The emergence of peer-to-peer insurance platforms where perhaps the only aspect of the market that is ‘centralized” will be autonomous agents that provide the commercial touchpoint for the ecosystem to work effectively.
While blockchain technology offers dynamic and unknown prospects for the future of the Insurance industry, the most challenging, and disruptive elements exist within the context of the surrounding the legality and regulation of the related decentralized applications that make the entire technology relevant.
Decentralized Autonomous Insurance Brokerage
Decentralized Autonomous Corporations, “A ÐAO is an algorithmically-governed programme that, in using trustless decentralised computing, can serve as a way to formalise multilateral relationships or transactions outside of traditional legal architecture. These automatons exist entirely as decentralized networks over the internet, carrying out the computations that keep them “alive” over thousands of servers that live entirely on the cloud and yet control powerful financial resources and can incentivize people to do very real things in the physical world[17] and or Smart contracts, are like an autonomous agent that runs a certain piece of code every time a transaction is sent to it, and this code can modify the contract’s internal data storage or send transactions. Advanced contracts can even modify their own code. Smart contracts are an idea that has been around for several decades, but was given its current name and first substantially brought to the (cryptography-inclined) public’s attention by Nick Szabo in 2005. In essence, the definition of a smart contract is simple: a smart contract is a contract that enforces itself.[18] these applications are built “on top’, but more accurately within the blockchain network, which would facilitate a Peer-to-peer transaction network, processing reputation through prediction markets, and execute the tenets of a policy for a group, or pool of consumers is a new approach to the already innovative P2P insurance concept. It endeavors to create a free-market environment for insurance seekers, and insurers, while at the same time providing a third group of speculators the ability to manage risk prediction market based reputation.
By design, Insurance inherently becomes a matching market of sorts, where users have a notion of the risk and coverage of the “pool” or “group” and creators have a notion of price, and can participate in the underwriting in conjunction with an insurance company, or many.
In this scenario, there is minimal intermediation — which drives down costs for all parties, there is no centralized authority that sets value, the social network becomes a true, decentralized market guided by its users. See the essay Formalising and Securing Relationships on Public Networks by Nick Szabo to learn more on the subject.[19]
Nick Szabo uses the example of a vending machine:
A canonical real-life example, which we might consider to be the primitive ancestor of smart contracts, is the humble vending machine. Within a limited amount of potential loss (the amount in the till should be less than the cost of breaching the mechanism), the machine takes in coins, and via a simple mechanism, which makes a freshman computer science problem in design with finite automata, dispense change and product according to the displayed price. The vending machine is a contract with bearer: anybody with coins can participate in an exchange with the vendor. The lockbox and other security mechanisms protect the stored coins and contents from attackers, sufficiently to allow profitable deployment of vending machines in a wide variety of areas.
Smart contracts are the application of this concept to, well, lots of things. We can have smart financial contracts that automatically shuffle money around based on certain formulas and conditions, smart domain name sale orders that give the domain to whoever first sends in $200, perhaps even smart insurance contracts that control bank accounts and automatically pay out based on some trusted source (or combination of sources) supplying data about real-world events.[21]
As you can see from above, Smart contracts are modular, repeatable, autonomous scripts, which can be used to build applications for yourself, for a community, for a client, for a bounty, or even for autonomous, self executing insurance policies.
Smart contracts can be coded to reflect any kind of business or engineering logic which is data-driven: from actions as simple as up-voting a post on a forum, in this case a prediction market tied to risk of the policy, or to the more complex, such as loan collateralisation and futures contracts, to the highly complex such as repayment prioritisation on a structured note.
By building business logic in smart contracts, developers (and lawyers) can give their users and clients an increase in the verifiability and certainty which comes with distributed technology while simultaneously building a system of rules which will be structured so that it can supersede regulation, as in the case of cross-state insurance regulation in the United States, as well as provide clear self-execution procedures for consumers to enable the automation of insurance brokerage.
What about the brokers as they exist right now you might ask? Let us step back for a moment from the specifics of smart contracts and think about a commercial deal which will involve many entities of different data-driven interactions within the market and the life of the application. How innovators for the commercial entities would likely structure the administration of the data driven aspects of the deal would be to establish a tracking system which is completely under the control of that commercial entity and, perhaps, provide some programmatic interface for others to query records or send new information regarding a record. It is likely that each of these dozen commercial entities will each establish a similar system to monitor and track the data interactions over the course of the deal. Therefore, in the case of the brokers, their role, as with the role of the insurers and everyone else on the network their actions will change, their competencies will need to change, but fundamentally, they will be required, however in a largely different capacity. It can be imagined that their role will essentially be the same, however, their efforts may be directed and facilitated through social media, or digitally, as a way to engage uninsured, or underinsured candidates to sign up to pools. They would become actors in the digital space that would be compensated for their ability to onboard constituents to the platform.
This is where the execution certainty of smart contracts married with the historical transaction certainty of a blockchain should become increasingly interesting for commercial players, now and into the future. If the commercial entities were wise about how they structured the deal, they could track all of their data-driven interactions on a smart contract-enabled blockchain without having to build twelve different systems, ensure their interoperability, and expend labour-time to appropriately categorize and file relevant transactional data. Every entity having access to the blockchain will be able to completely verify the entirety of the interactions as well as the entire history of the data set, which would be automatically maintained over the life of the deal and summarised at its conclusion.
While the different commercial entities may be legally incorporated and would not be required to move to a completely trustless system of the kind described above, they would all experience significant cost savings from the increased verifiability and automation a blockchain-based smart contract system would permit.
Mitigating Legal, Regulatory and Policy Frameworks with Smart Contracts and DAOs
Smart Contracts: self-enforceability vs. legal enforceability
Smart contracts also eliminate the need for trust amongst the parties, who can be sure that the contract will be performed exactly as agreed. Indeed, as opposed to traditional legal contracts, smart contracts are always and necessarily deterministic — i.e. all possible outcomes of the contract (including penalties for breach of contract) must be explicitly stipulated in advance — something akin to what liquidated damages clauses and letters of credit do in the paper world..[22]
Discussion is currently very focused on the technical aspects of smart contract deployment and their implementation within a particular technological framework. Smart contract proponents claim that many contractual clauses could be made partially or fully self-executing, self-enforcing, or both. Smart contracts aim to provide security superior to traditional contract law and to reduce other transaction costs associated with contracting. Some even propose a future where self-enforcing algorithmic law would supplant traditional law.
Yet, many people forget that these applications are meant to operate in a world that is regulated by traditional rules of law. While smart contracts are increasingly able to handle complex deal logics, many kinds of transactions do — eventually — have to interface with the “real world”. It is at those “choke points” that the legal system will ultimately have a say in the context of a breach.
In this regard, one important question is to determine whether smart contracts are in fact actionable in the real world. While they can be regarded, at their core, as a written contract drafted in a computer language, it is not clear — at this date — whether their code is “legally binding” upon the parties interacting with these contracts. Legal enforceability would essentially allow for only the main-case set to be handled by smart-contracts, leaving the edge-case set to be handled by the courts.[23]
Most importantly, in many real-world situations, contracts are performed without the need to be enforced by law, as the threat of one party resorting to the legal system is sufficient for the other party to comply with the contracted terms. In order to be as effective as their traditional counterparts, smart contracts must therefore also be actionable in the real world. This might, of course, requires them to comply with all the standard formalities required for a court to enforce a contract under the law.
I would propose through another interesting blockchain company and tool developer Eris Industries, a way to extend the reach of blockchain-based transactions by having smart contracts render into conventional legal documents. This allows for the smart contracts (as the administration layer) to remain simple, while relying on the legal contracts (as the enforcement layer) to handle the edge cases.
The Blockchain and Dual Legal Integration
Dual integration is the process of integrating a specific legal contract (which can be built with Legal Markdown or any other contract building system) into a specific smart contract which runs on a distributed data store such as Eris Industries’ [24]
The idea of dual integration is to allow users to be able to have the certainty of having a real world contract which can be taken to a court and enforced using established dispute resolution processes in the jurisdiction(s) of the user(s) while also using a smart contract as the primary mechanism for administering the data-driven interaction which attends to the agreement between the parties.
For another system which is also seeking to bridge this gap see Primavera de Filippi’s Draft Legal Framework For Crypto-Ledger Transactions.[25]
The reason Eris Industries recommends to all users of Distributed Technology, and particularly smart contracts, to dual-integrate their smart contracts with real world legal contracts built by lawyers qualified in the jurisdiction(s) that will be relevant to the agreement, is simple. Smart contracts are necessarily limited.
As they are, at their core, just scripts which live in a distributed data store, the pure code of a smart contract has a limited ability to “reach” outside the context of their data store to incorporate a legally-binding contractual understanding. While they are capable of being structured in a manner which would automatically administer a data-driven interaction and ensure harmony of the data set in which the smart contracts reside (if they have permissions to do so),judges are unlikely, for the foreseeable future, to be able to easily resolve disputes stemming from smart contracts solely on the basis of their coded parameters (meaning without an integrated legal contract) without simply applying the commercial defaults for the agreement in the jurisdiction — an end that is unlikely to reflect the intention of the parties to the agreement in question. For these reasons of the limited reach of smart contracts and the limited enforceability of smart contracts, we highly encourage all smart contract systems developers to utilize dual integration of some kind.
Risk and Transactional Insurance Prediction Markets
Market-based principles can be used to manage the risk of distributed peer-to-peer transactions. This is demonstrated by PTRIM, (Peer-to-Peer Transaction Risk Management) a system that builds a transaction default market on top of a main transaction processing system, within which peers offer to underwrite the transaction risk for a slight increase in the transaction cost. Essentially a Peer-to-peer prediction network to facilitate the truth of market/network risk and reputation in processing a transaction within a financial market.
Prediction markets (also known as predictive markets, information markets, decision markets, idea futures, event derivatives, or virtual markets) are exchange-traded markets created for the purpose of trading the outcome of events. The market prices can indicate what the crowd thinks the probability of the event is. A prediction market contract trades between 0 and 100%. It is a binary option that will expire at the price of 0 or 100%.
Research has suggested that prediction markets are at least as accurate as other institutions predicting the same events with a similar pool of participants[26] this has a profound, if not purely innovative approach to assessing risk in an insurance network. The insurance cost, determined through market-based mechanisms, is a way of identifying untrustworthy peers and perilous transactions. The risk of the transactions is contained, and at the same time members of the peer-to-peer network capitalise on their market knowledge by profiting as transaction insurers.
It is being progressively recognised that information systems and applications supporting collaborative tasks, including online transaction processing systems, that currently follow centralized client-server models can also be based on the maturing wave of peer-to-peer architectures [27,28]. In order to manage and reduce the risk inherent in peer-to-peer transactions and their decentralised and uncontrolled environment, a variety of approaches have been proposed, with reputation and trust management systems being the most prominent.[29]
These aim to provide peers with estimates of the risk involved in their transactions, based on the observed past behaviour of their counterparties. Though reputation management systems (either centralized or distributed) offer a lot in this direction, the information they provide about past behaviour may not be enough to accurately assess the risk involved in a transaction.
On top of a generic transaction processing system, PTRIM creates a peer-to-peer transaction insurance market-like layer that is used to manage the risk of transaction default. The transacting peers have the option to request offers from peers in this layer to underwrite the risk of their transaction, and therefore alleviate themselves from the need to collect, process and evaluate reputation information.[30]

Image credit: A Market-Based approach to Managing the Risk of Peer-to-Peer Transactions
A transaction default market is thus built on top of the main transaction processing system, within which the cost of “insuring” a transaction is determined through market-based mechanisms. The main contribution of our approach is that it proposes a novel way of identifying untrustworthy peers and perilous transactions, based on the insurance offers the market will produce; the risk of peer-to-peer transactions is contained at a small additional cost; and at the same time, our system showcases a way for members of a peer-to-peer network to participate in a new profitable role, as transaction insurers.
Our approach for managing the risk of distributed peer-to-peer transactions is based on the principles governing financial markets. PTRIM builds and utilises a transaction default market on top of a main transaction processing system, within which peers offer to underwrite the transaction risk for a slight increase in the transaction cost.[31]
The cost is determined through market-based mechanisms, and forms a way of identifying untrustworthy peers and perilous transactions. The risk of the transactions is effectively minimised while the transacting peers are alleviated from the need to collect, process and evaluate reputation information. At the same time our system showcases a way for members of a peer-to-peer network to capitalise on their market knowledge by participating in a new role, as transaction insurers.
The PTRIM approach can be considered as an alternative, but also as complementary to the use of distributed reputation management systems. Under this system, individuals would vote not on whether or not to implement particular policies, but rather on a metric to determine how well their country (or charity or company) is doing, and then “prediction markets” would be used to pick the policies that best optimize the metric.
Essentially, you are literally putting your money where your mouth is. Second, over time the market has an evolutionary pressure to get better; the individuals who are bad at predicting the outcome of policies will lose money, and so their influence on the market will decrease, whereas the individuals who are good at predicting the outcome of policies will see their money and influence on the market increase.
The system also elegantly combines public participation and professional analysis. Many people decry democracy as a descent to mediocrity and demagoguery, and prefer decisions to be made by skilled technocratic experts. Individual experts and even entire analysis firms to make individual investigations and analyses, incorporate their findings into the decision by buying and selling on the market, and make a profit from the differential in information between themselves and the public[32]
So what are the practical benefits of adopting such a scheme? What is wrong with simply having blockchain-based organizations that follow more traditional models of governance, or even more democratic ones? Cryptographic protocols have a much lower need for trusting central authorities (if you are not inclined to distrust central authorities, the argument can be more accurately rephrased as “cryptographic protocols can more easily generalize to gain the efficiency, equity and informational benefits of being more participatory and inclusive without leading to the consequence that you end up trusting unknown individuals”).[33]
Conclusion
The potential for blockchain technology to significantly transform the way the insurance industry operates in the near term, is inevitable. The question is who will do it, and what will it look like?
Blockchain technology adoption and the development of related applications in insurance is likely to depend on insurance industry practitioners and their readiness and appetite, however innovative startups around the world are challenging the notion of what this future might look like, which may force incumbents to adopt new ways of doing business faster than they expect.
Insurance players, their digital innovation units in particular, need to “explore and exploit” in order to manage evolutionary and revolutionary change. Explore the power of this new tool, yet exploit their existing business in order to provide the necessary framework to manage innovation in their space properly.
I hope that these some of the ideas and applications that I have described above, have inspired you to think about, what is out there, and what is possible with blockchain technology. Moreover, I hope that whatever you create solves a massive and important problem in the world, and makes the insurance industry work better for consumers and society.

Pence says Obamacare ‘failed’ Kentucky, where 500,000 gained insurance through the law
In 2013, 20.4% of Kentuckians were uninsured. In 2016, 7.8% were.

Speaking in Louisville, Kentucky on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence called Obamacare a “nightmare,” and said that Kentucky was a “textbook case of Obamacare’s failures.”
There’s only one problem with those statements — Obamacare provided insurance to 20 million Americans, and Kentucky has actually been one of Obamacare’s biggest success stories.
In 2013, 20.4 percent of Kentucky residents were uninsured. In 2016, that number had fallen to 7.8 percent. Kentucky governor Matt Bevin, who actually campaigned on getting rid of Obamacare, found once he entered office that because the health care plan was helping so many people, he couldn’t kill it easily. Instead, he merely rebranded the law to make it more friendly to conservatives.
Many people in Kentucky now have insurance through the expansion of Medicaid, which was a central part of Obamacare, or Kynect, which is Kentucky’s name for its Obamacare exchange.

Before Pence’s speech on Saturday, Louisville mayor Greg Fischer released a statement urging the vice president and the rest of the federal government to “slow down and get health care right — for the sake of 500,000 Kentuckians, including 100,000 Louisville residents, who have garnered coverage under the Affordable Care Act.”
But patience is not a virtue this administration has been shown to value. This week, House Republicans released their official plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. The Trumpcare plan includes massive cuts to Medicaid, defunds Planned Parenthood, eliminates abortion coverage, and provides a huge tax break for CEOs of insurance companies making over $500,000 a year. It is being opposed by a wide range of groups, from the American Medical Association to America’s Health Insurance Plans.
It would also significantly raise prices for the poor, particularly those who are older.
Just two days after that plan was unveiled to the public, the House Ways and Means Committee advanced the legislation without any changes at 4:30 a.m. with a 23–16 vote in the bill’s favor. It is clear that supporters of the bill, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, are trying to fast-track the bill through Congress despite the fact that the Congressional Budget Office hasn’t yet released a report estimating the cost and how many people could lose coverage under the bill.
Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act are the same thing
They are the same, not different.thinkprogress.org
Pence’s speech in Kentucky — which also addressed strengthening our military and stopping undocumented immigrants from crossing the border, and Trump’s Supreme Court nomination — didn’t include many details at all about the new health care legislation. Instead, he focused on the anti-Obamacare talking points that Trump campaigned on, mainly the cost and the lack of competition in the marketplace.
While nobody is arguing that Obamacare is perfect and can’t be improved, repealing the bill without a comprehensive replacement plan would be extremely damaging. One report estimates that the Obamacare repeal could cost the United States 1.2 million jobs. Most significantly, more than 36,000 people could die each year without it, including Kentucky residents.
“Of course I worry about if my cancer were to come back what would happen, but now I have to add to that what would happen if I lose my health insurance,” cancer survivor and Kentucky resident Leah Briemer, who credits the Affordable Care Act for saving her life, told ABC News last month. “My daughter’s 18. She’s graduating from high school. I need to be here for my daughter. Help her get through college. Help her have a wedding. See my grandchildren be born.”
She added, “When something’s working for so many people and you decide you’re going to take it away. And you say it’s horrible, it’s not working for anyone, even though it is, yeah that’s playing politics with my life and many others.”

The afterlife insurance policy
Image: Nanda Green
Unfortunately, for a lot of religious folks out there, this is the extent to which they venture in their faith.
An afterlife insurance policy.
Years and years of church on Sundays. 
Years and years of accessibility to timeless wisdom in their Good Book.
And it sits mostly unopened. 
To be taken at uninterpreted face value by the voice from the pulpit.
Sterile. 
Shallow.
Childish.
Restricting.
All for an afterlife insurance policy.
What a divine opportunity they pass up. This life is too short to not explore the depths, work through the doubt, and unlock the ancient mysteries of what lies within the poetry and story of a living faith.
There’s more there that lies unopened.
More value to this life before death.

GOP congressman says fewer people with health insurance is a ‘good thing’
Shhhhhh. You weren’t supposed to say that part out loud.
Rep. Mike Burgess (R-TX) CREDIT: AP Photo/Evan Vucci
Republican efforts to build a more laissez-faire health system are “doomed to fail,” conservative health policy writer Philip Klein admitted in a candid column last month, unless they are willing to state an uncomfortable truth: Republicans must acknowledge that they “don’t believe that it is the job of the federal government to guarantee that everybody has health insurance.”
A handful of GOP lawmakers are now taking up Klein’s charge — with one of them even claiming that a Republican plan that leads to a higher national uninsurance rate would be a good thing.
“If the numbers drop,” Rep. Mike Burgess (R-TX) said Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, “I would say that’s a good thing.” He went on to argue that more people without health care would be a positive thing for the United States because it would mean that “we’ve restored personal liberty in this country.”
Trump voters covered by Obamacare don’t like the GOP’s health care ideas
The GOP’s plan takes away the things they like, and makes the things they dislike worse.thinkprogress.org
Burgess’ prediction that Republican health plans will lead to a drop in the national insurance rate was echoed by Rep. Dennis Ross (R-FL) in an interview with Bloomberg this week. “Not everybody is going to have health care” under a Republican health plan, Ross said. “Some people just don’t care enough about their own care.”
Bloomberg also shares some details about the health policy ideas that are starting to gain traction among Republican lawmakers. While the full contours of the GOP’s “replacement” for Obamacare remain elusive, the details we do know off confirm that yes, Republicans are indeed pushing ideas that would lead to fewer people receiving care.
More expensive plans for people who can’t afford it
The Affordable Care Act tackles two interlocking challenges. Older Americans tend to have more medical expenses, and thus pay higher health premiums that may be unaffordable for many of these individuals. Meanwhile, many Americans simply don’t earn enough income to be able to afford insurance.
Obamacare provides that insurers cannot charge their oldest customers more than three times as much as their youngest customers. Meanwhile, it provides tax credits that help low-to-moderate income individuals pay for their insurance. These tax credits are higher for people with lower incomes, due to the fact that people who are less-well-off will have less ability to pay insurance premiums without greater financial assistance.
Several Republican proposals would increase the amount that insurers could charge older Americans. A bill would increase the age band from 5 to 1 (above the current range of 3 to 1). One of the more comical ideas to emerge from the Trump administration was a proposal to interpret existing law to allow insurers to charge older individuals 3.49 times as much as younger consumers, on the theory that 3.49 rounds down to 3. (This later proposal appears to have been scrapped.)
Meanwhile, according to Bloomberg, Republicans hope to base tax credits on a person’s age rather than on their income. Such a proposal could simultaneously be wasteful and merciless, since an age-based formula could allow wealthy individuals who can afford to pay their own premiums to still receive a government subsidy — while also denying low-income Americans the assistance they need to purchase insurance at all.
Driving up costs and collapsing entire insurance markets
Another idea that is reportedly gaining steam among Republicans is a proposal to “do away with the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that all Americans have health coverage or pay a fine, and replace it with rules that let people choose not to buy insurance, instead paying higher premiums or penalties if they need it later.”
Though the details of such a proposal are sparse — just how much higher would premiums be if someone delays buying health insurance until they get sick? — such a proposal risks driving up the cost of care for people who are already insured, or, worse, collapsing entire insurance markets altogether.
The reason why the Affordable Care Act penalizes people who do not carry insurance is because of the risk that people will wait until they are sick to become insured and then drain all the money out of an insurance pool that they haven’t paid into.
Because Obamacare forbids insurers from denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions, insurers cannot simply refuse to cover people with expensive conditions. If the ratio of healthy people to sick people in a given insurance plan tilts too heavily towards people with expensive conditions, however, then the plan will need to jack up premiums in order to cover the costs of its most expensive consumers.
That risks setting off a “death spiral,” where healthy people leave the plan due to rising premiums, which forces the insurer to raise premiums even more, which causes even more healthy people to leave. Eventually, the entire insurance pool collapses.
Obamacare solves this problem by requiring people who don’t carry insurance to pay higher income taxes, thus giving them an incentive to enter an insurance pool while they are still healthy. Republicans reportedly want to eliminate this provision and, instead, charge a penalty to people who wait too long to buy insurance.
It’s far from clear, however, that such a mechanism would be sufficient to ward off death spirals. Imagine a hypothetical consumer, for example, who has to choose between paying $200 a month now, or to pay nothing now — but with the caveat that they will be charged $1,000 a month if they are later diagnosed with a catastrophic illness. Many people are likely to decide that they should pay nothing now and hope for the best, especially since, even in the worst case scenario, they will still have the option to buy insurance when they need it most.
Alternatively, Republicans could set the penalties for remaining insured so high that insurance would be unaffordable for someone who waits until they are seriously ill to buy insurance. That would have the virtue of helping to ward off a death spiral, but at the cost of many people’s lives.


Where is all the innovation in insurance? Let the capital flow.
A giant and heavily regulated industry which many would argue has lost sight of its customers should be ripe for attack. After all, entrepreneurs are tackling some of the toughest challenges in sectors like healthcare, transportation and financial services, using software to radically transform the product offering. Yet insurance has been overlooked, protected by large capital requirements and regulatory complexity.
No more. We’re engaging with a new generation of insurance companies, founded by entrepreneurs who want to take on this $3.5 trillion industry.
Insurance companies’ biggest oversight is simple: they have not been serving their customers. Actually, they rarely interact with their customers, since the vast majority of their business comes through brokers. Brokers are treated as their customers, and collect $45 billion of fees every year from insurers globally. It should come as no surprise that the web and mobile customer experience for consumer and SME insurance is shocking, since the DNA of most insurance companies is heavily B2B. They don’t know how to relate to end-consumers. (In this post, I am primarily referring to consumers and SMEs, rather than large corporate customers that continue to be served well by insurers.)
There are a few notable exceptions, such as GEICO and Progressive in the US and Admiral in the UK, that have demonstrated the economic benefits of going direct, eliminating broker commissions and building a more engaged customer relationship. And some insurance companies are slowly waking up to the need to develop consumer DNA, and to rebuild their internal systems to support a direct model. But most of this is invisible to their end-customers and has little positive impact near-term. The banks are a few years ahead on re-designing legacy infrastructure to support a new customer paradigm; we are sceptical that their transformation will be fast enough, which suggests that insurers too will struggle to compete with focused new entrants.
The broken customer value proposition
Most consumers view insurance as a tax on their income and do not look forward to the annual communication from their broker/insurance company containing the renewal premium. To begin with, it has often increased, inexplicably, from the prior year, even in the absence of any claim. Second, consumers also don’t believe their insurance company will fully pay out, even when they have a legitimate claim. As a result, end-customers have limited brand loyalty to their insurer, especially for property & casualty and for health insurance. Third, the customer experience is consistently poor. One notable exception is claims handling, although that has less value since claims may only occur every 5 years or so.
All this leads to a situation where consumers churn frequently and shop around heavily based on price. They know that insurers quote lower prices for new customers, and then hike prices in year 2 — new customers are basically subsidized by those who don’t churn — which in turn creates a vicious cycle, incentivizing customers to switch constantly. There remains some loyalty in life insurance, but only because it is so painful to get through the upfront paperwork and medical exam that most consumers cannot be bothered to switch.
Finally, not only is the overall customer proposition weak, but the insurance industry is one of the biggest laggards in developing even minimally acceptable online and mobile customer experiences.
These factors create opportunities for startups at various parts of the insurance value chain, across property & casualty, health, and life insurance:
The next generation broker
Brokers can and do play an important role in ensuring that a customer understands the nuances of the product and that it matches their needs. However, brokers must adapt as software encroaches on their world. In wealth management, the role of the broker is being disrupted by new robo-advisor services such as Wealthfront and Betterment, and brokers such as Charles Schwab are reacting by offering their own automated investing products (for free in Schwab’s case) and investing in more powerful tools to improve the advice they provide. In real estate, Compass’s software enables brokers to reduce the time spent in the office on paperwork and admin, freeing them to get out and market properties. Compass has attracted many top-producing brokers from other firms because of the boost to income that can result from operating on their platform.
In insurance, the first internet product innovation came with the price comparison sites with their lead-gen models — services like Moneysupermarket in the UK, and Check24 in Germany (an investment Simon worked with pre-Mosaic). More recently, tech-powered next-gen brokers have emerged, including Knip and GetSafe in Europe, and Policy Genius, Coverhound and TheZebra in the US. But the state of insurers’ APIs (or lack thereof) makes it difficult for brokers to offer a comprehensive and seamless customer experience for finding and purchasing the right policy, so customers often have to make at least one phone call to complete the process — not ideal at all.
Innovating on insurance structure
There is plenty of (re-)insurance capital interested in supporting new insurance products and models; the problem is connecting it to the entrepreneurs that are doing the innovating. Founders of insurance startups discover that even if they have end-customer demand for their product, finding a licensed insurance company to underwrite policies is not straightforward. The world of underwriting has become homogenized in recent years, with standardization of ratings tables and very little creativity allowed by corporate guidelines. This was one of the the key issues highlighted at a “Future of Insurance” roundtable hosted recently by Mosaic. One entrepreneur complained underwriters are “box tickers called Derek, who probably still live with their Mum, sitting in regional offices across Europe, without any ability or license to price a risk outside their nice square box”. And the insurance market and its capital that funds traditional underwriters does not have a good mechanism to bypass them and more directly fund innovators.
Founders such as Steven Mendel at BoughtbyMany are trying to tackle this challenge by moving up the value chain and taking more of an active role in underwriting, in close collaboration with several insurance partners. BoughtbyMany is going after white space, assembling groups of people with very specific insurance needs (e.g. users of quad-bikes or owners of classic cars) who cannot easily find (affordable) insurance as individuals — BoughtbyMany can negotiate discounts by aggregating them into larger groups. However, even with the scale of these groups of customers, insurance capital was not easily flowing into the groups, and BoughtbyMany recently acquired a traditional insurance broker that came with a set of underwriter relationships, so they could underwrite these policies themselves.
For founders who want to have complete control over their product, pricing, go-to-market and target customer profile, which is typically true with the most ambitious founders we know, then they need to become a “full-stack” insurance company, with their own underwriting capability. They may choose to outsource claims management or medical assessments, but without being able to issue their own paper, they will always be beholden to one or more underwriters. The regulatory capital requirements to become an underwriter actually start quite low at approximately $5 million in Europe or the US, and once an insurance business is up and running, the cash flow characteristics can be attractive, as Warren Buffett has demonstrated with his 50 year track record in insurance. Startups may be able to fund marketing from their float, but they will need to increase their capital base if they grow their book very fast.
Venture capital investors have different return profiles from insurers/reinsurers and to date have shown limited appetite for a blended VC/reinsurance return on their capital. This may be a mistake given the overall returns available to innovators in this space. Oscar has raised over $370 million of smart venture capital in the health insurance business, a large portion of which has been invested as regulatory capital to support underwriting their health insurance policies. Some entrepreneurs are looking at structures in which they finance their operating business with VC money and their captive underwriting vehicle with reinsurance capital, which may get around this issue. And startups such as Uvamo are exploring using a P2P marketplace to provide underwriting capital.
The mutual insurance model
The Hand in Hand Fire & Life Insurance Society was one of the oldest British insurance companies, founded in 1696 right after the Great Fire of London. It was the first mutual model of insurance which was owned and run for the benefit of its members — they were one of the first peer-to-peer finance startups. Members would pay their premia into a single pool and claims would be paid out. At year-end, if there was money left in the pool, members would receive a dividend. Guevara is a new Mosaic-backed team that is building a similar peer-to-peer model (albeit 300 years later), with a product that enables small groups of people with common relationships to form and be incentivized to keep claims low. We are excited about the potential of a peer-to-peer model in insurance that can fuel low-cost customer acquisition, motivate members to minimise losses, and enjoy low churn, with any benefits realised in the form of lower premia in future years.
New risk pools
Technology also enables insurance opportunities in new areas. Cyber-security is one of the fastest growing new areas within insurance. In the same way that Zenefits monetises its software through selling insurance policies, we think that cyber-security software startups may use an insurance product to underpin their business model. We also believe that on-demand insurance enabled by smartphones will be important — rather than annual coverage, Uber drivers may be offered buy coverage by the hour (e.g. Cuvva), Airbnb hosts by the night or Taskrabbits by the day, and in emerging markets this may become the standard for how insurance is sold. Existing actuarial models and claims data are not easily applied to new risk pools, and therefore startups have an opportunity to address these under-served markets.
Robo-advisor powered life insurance
Old fashioned life insurance as a protection product is in decline. At today’s mortality rates, consumers see limited value in paying 40 years worth of premia without seeing a pot of money build up over time. Consumers prefer to see life insurance as a long-term savings product that can support them and their families after retirement or death, which may make sense once the tax benefits of a pension or 401k have been maximised. Robo-advisor platforms (such as Wealthfront) are best positioned to provide this type of “life insurance”, rather than the current crop of confusing and expensive products from large insurers such as Allianz, Aviva, or AXA, with embedded and hidden costs of 300–600bps compared to 20bps for Wealthfront.
As you can tell, we think the insurance industry is ripe for founders to tackle head-on. For consumers, it’s clear there is an unmet need: if only there was a value proposition where a customer could pay a premium that reflects their true risk profile and, in the event of a claim, take out their “insurance claim card” and pay for all reasonable expenses with it. There are many opportunities resulting from this, none of which are straightforward, but the prizes will be large. Insurance capital will need to flow to these entrepreneurs to underwrite risk, in partnership with venture capital to fund operations. If you are working on an ambitious startup in this area, we would love to hear from you.

Recent Email Sent By Insurance Company CEO to Patients Who Will Be Denied Healthcare Coverage
Once the Affordable Care Act is Repealed
Dear Valued Customer:
Here at MediAlliedBarnes&NobleExxonHealth, our mission is to provide patients with access to quality, affordable healthcare. In the last month, we’ve received thousands of messages from community members concerned about the repeal of Obamacare. We want you to know WE HEAR YOU™! And while it’s true, those with pre-existing conditions will soon be denied care, we wish you well as you continue your journey without us, without any insurance whatsoever.
As a gesture of good will, we suggest the following alternative therapies as possible solutions to meet your healthcare needs:
Those suffering with CANCER could take a trip to a sacred Inca site for a weekend of meditation and communion with Earth Mother (“Pachamama”). A group of mystics can be found wandering around Lake Poopó, and are available to perform various shamanistic rituals and tarot card readings.
ALZHEIMER’S is a terrible disease that will no longer be covered. Patients are encouraged to get a puzzle book, maybe take up Sudoku. Before she died, my Aunt Helen had this little bag of healing crystals that she carried around in her purse. They helped her manage symptoms. Another thing you could do is get a miniature bonsai plant to cheer yourself up.
All patients with DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, and MOOD DISORDERS will now be denied insurance. While this is unfortunate, I’m pleased to announce a new initiative, inspired by our recent merger with Barnes and Noble: a 15% discount on all purchases of the book The Secret, to help you manifest a happier future. Just enter the code: “PositiveVibesOnly” at check-out.
All claims for PEDIATRIC CONDITIONS will automatically be denied, so try to get a relaxed, carefree baby who doesn’t have any problems. Otherwise, you’re on your own.
ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION is another pre-existing condition we won’t be covering any longer. However, a prominent British sexologist has shown rubbing avocado paste down there might help, so you could try that.
The best of luck, and good health to you all!
Sincerely,
Dr. Dick McGall

While Insurance is a massive industry, for example net premiums for life and P&C insurance the US are estimated worth around $1,000,000,000,000 (yes that is twelve zeros) I believe it has just been barely affected by the massive software driven changes that other industries are experiencing.
At core, the Insurance industry is impacted by the same underlying trends as the Banking Industry:
Transparency
Online comparators have brought unheard of transparency in pricing. In markets such as the UK, 56% of consumers declared having used a price comparison website in the last 2 years. This is no exception that Google started its move in the insurance space there. In the US, a growing number of companies are looking to play this role, positioning themselves as broker with examples such as Coverhound and Policy Genius.
But that transparency is starting to expand beyond just pricing but how an insurance policy covers an individual’s risk at granular level. In mass market, insurance products, while relevant to the risk profile of the individual from the perspective of the insurer, tend to lack detailed granular level from the perspective of the customer. Companies, such as Trov (disclosure: Anthemis is an investor), are helping to create this customisation in the Home Content insurance by allowing coverage of key items vs having a policy with a coverage set with averaged amounts. Metromile is another example in the motor insurance industry.
Impact of Digital on Distribution
The Insurance Industry, due to its specificities, has evolved to a reseller model (whether captive or independent). However with online distribution channels becoming increasingly primary channels, will the insurance agent suffer the same fate as the bank branch? As digital distribution channels prefer scale, it can be expected that markets with a large number of small broker players will face intense consolidation going forward, as shown by the rapid consolidation of the UK insurance market. The success of Direct Distribution models in some countries, including China, can also be be a hint to what is coming next. Will the brokers be disintermediated? Or will they find new value add activities to justify their existence?

Source: MCKinsey Global Insurance Industry Insights
As we have seen in other industries, it is very difficult to turn itself into a digital first company. It may sound cliché but the Innovator Dilemma effect is playing at full when most of your current revenue base depends on traditional distribution / management methods. We are just starting to see the emergence of new digital first carriers, with companies like Oscar leading. Oscar’s mobile experience not only reduces its operational cost but helps redefine the link between carrier, customer and physician and potentially affect risk levels. It also provides a flexible platform that can adapt to emerging new technologies such as wearables.

Oscar’s partnership with Misfit
From a Venture Capital perspective it is an expensive proposition with an important part of capital required for regulatory requirement but taking a longer term view, these balance sheet companies may turn more attractive in a regularised rate environment.
Beyond, if you think of insurance as a class of exotic financial products, is there a possibility for larger scale disintermediation similar to banks and alternative lending possible for carriers and alternative insurance funds.
Big Data
Insurance is in many ways the historical big data business and in trendier places, one might be able to call actuaries data scientists. One of the historical asset of insurance is in its past loss data. However with the exponential growth of sensors in our world new sources of data emerge (see Metromile as well)

Source: KPCB
Additionally companies such as Google, Facebook or Amazon are more likely to have attracted top data talents than traditional carriers. A good example is the success of Climate Corporation (a former Anthemis portfolio company, founded by an ex-Google employee and acquired in 2013 by Monsanto. By leveraging publicly available weather data including the large network of weather stations maintained by NOAA in the US and combining it with a modern big data infrastructure built from the ground up, Climate Corporation was able to provide instant weather insurance quotes.
In the B2B insurance world, for the most part, Lloyds of London still relies heavily on email and excel. When databases exist, they are often siloed from each others and sits in technology that makes live manipulation of data very difficult or impossible. Companies such as Quantemplate (disclosure: I am a non executive director and Anthemis is an investor) bring data efficiency to players that have been struggling with it. The ability to manipulate complex data has the potential to reinforce an algorithmic approach on risk in these markets.
However, perhaps even more than banking, I believe the insurance industry will be facing fundamental challenges in the near future. One way to think about it is perhaps to start again from the definition of insurance itself.
Insurance is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent, uncertain loss. (Wikipedia)
Risk
The combination of an increased number of sensors and computational abilities has the ability to largely impact existing pools of risk. The car industry is a typical example. Statistics tend to show that the human factor a.k.a the driver is the first (by a large percentage — 94% in the US) cause of accidents. Looking further into the statistics the first two reasons are recognition error and decision error for a total of 75%. While fully automated cars may be sligthly further away in the picture, machine assisted driving is on the verge of becoming available in the mass market. Whether via radars or sensors, self braking mechanisms are being deployed by car manufacturers.

To put this in perspective, motor insurance represent about 30% of overall premiums for P&C insurance in Europe. With lower collision risks, premium will be expected to lower as well (and the additional cost of electronics onboard will not compensate for the difference). One of the underlying question is whether with lowered premiums and less variability per driver, the insurance could be embedded in the cost of the vehicle itself. At what point do insurance and guarantee start to look more and more the same?
As software is having more and more impact on our life, the question on risks attached to it, whether digital reputation, or impact of software failure in the real world is becoming more and more important. Will risk shift to software provider away from individuals and traditional companies. For example, should Google or the user be insured for a Google Car?
Contingent
With more and more sensors accompanying us daily and measuring the way we move, eat and feel, is the level of contingency on an individual’s health shifting? There are several experiments by insurance companies in leveraging wearables for prevention in health plans. Oscar is running a specific program with Misfit and Vitality‘s insurance program has a strong focus on prevention. From a strategic point of view it makes sense for insurers to run this type of programs as they might benefit from an indirect self selection process, assuming people wearing wearables are more health conscious than the average population and have less exposure to certain risk (an equivalent of the original Progressive strategy in car insurance).
Alongside sensors the progress in genetic testing (speed and costs as well as the increased ability to run large statistical research) will also ask for a clarification of the role of insurance / and who should provide it (educating myself on this topic so leaving it at that for the moment)
Uncertain
If there is an industry that has no doubt on the reality of climate change, that’s the insurance industry. One of the key topic of the Geneva Association (one of the leading think tank of the insurance industry) is Extreme Event and Climate Risk. For a large part the insurance industry is relying on their historical data to derive their model around risk. However if conditions are changing rapidly, these models have a risk of becoming less relevant. This is forcing the insurance industry to reevaluate the way the work, for example fostering the creation of Open Source models and platforms. The OASIS loss modelling framework, fostered by Climate-KIC and the UK Knowledge Transfer Network, is an example of this type of approach. More generally, the emergence of cross industry data sources, models and the infrastructure to support it bear the promise to massively affect the way the brokerage and insurance industry is operating.
Finally, some of the early models of insurance were based on the sharing of risks and rewards by a community of people (in themutual insurance model, policy holders co-own their insurance company- Benjamin Franklin “launched” this model in the US). In the last years we have seen, via the Internet and mobile now that online communities have reached a scale of unheard scale. Combining the two to reinvent the mutual insurance is therefore bound to happen.
The early players in this field for example Friendsurance and Guevara, have both started from the brokerage spectrum of the industry (as it is a much easier entry point from a regulatory / capital point of view). My way of framing what they do is that it is a form of arbitrage on deductibles. By pooling an equivalent of a low deductible insurance subscription but effectively subscribing to a high deductible insurance product, they are creating a reserve pool of cash for the group to manage first claims. Pool creation and distribution of risk among pools, effective claim management, customer acquisition journey are the type of challenges these models are facing.
The emergence of blockchain / distributed application technologies has the potential to massively increase innovation in this space. A Blockchain based mutual insurance could not only distribute risks and ownership among members but also some of its infrastructure and logic including capital contribution. If you are thinking of doing something in that field, Eris Industries (disclosure: I am a non executive director and Anthemis is an investor) are the people you should talk to!
The Insurance Industry is about to change radically and rapidly, creating a massive opportunity for innovative companies to emerge and improve massively on the way insurance is built, bought and experienced.

GOP congressman says Trumpcare will force people to choose between new iPhone and health insurance
Freedom!
CREDIT: CNN screengrab
During a Tuesday morning appearance on CNN, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) suggested that under Trumpcare, Americans will face some tough choices — like buying an iPhone or making sure they can see a doctor.
Pressed by CNN’s Alisyn Camerota about whether he’s concerned Trumpcare’s reduced tax incentives and lack of individual mandate will result in less people having insurance, Chaffetz said, “Well, we’re getting rid of the individual mandate. We’re getting rid of those things that people said that they don’t want.”
6 things you should know about Trumpcare
House Republicans released the long-awaited bill on Monday.thinkprogress.org
“And you know what? Americans have choices, and they’ve gotta make a choice,” he continued. “And so maybe rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and they want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest in their own health care. They’ve gotta make those decisions themselves.”

The cost of a new iPhone 7 without a contract is roughly $700. By comparison, the per-capita cost of health care in the U.S. last year was $10,345. Even when insurance coverage that defrays some of that cost is factored in, Americans still spend way less on phones than they do on health care.

If too many healthy people decide to forego health care they don’t think they’ll need in favor of new phones under Trumpcare, prices will go up for those remaining in the health insurance market, creating a “death spiral.”
Ironically, Chaffetz — chair of the House oversight committee — referenced the “death spiral” phenomenon earlier in the CNN interview.
“We campaigned on this, assured the American people that if you put Republicans in charge, we would fix what is in a death spiral,” Chaffetz said.
Chaffetz — who during a different part of the interview said he plans to investigate President Trump’s (groundless) wiretapping allegations, but has not shown any willingness to investigate Trump’s shady ties with Russia — also applauded the legislative process Republicans plan to use to implement health care reform.
GOP congressman thinks poor people don’t want health care, ‘just like Jesus said’
“There is a group of people that just don’t want health care and aren’t going to take care of themselves.”thinkprogress.org
“Do you know what I really like about it? We’re going to do it in an open and transparent way, unlike what the Democrats did with the Affordable Care Act where they rammed it through,” Chaffetz said.
House committees are actually expected to hold votes on the two Trumpcare bills as early as Wednesday, before the Congressional Budget Office has finished its analysis of how much the bill will cost or how many people will lose insurance coverage. Millions are expected to lose coverage if Trumpcare is passed — a reality acknowledged by Chaffetz in the CNN interview.
“More access, but possibly less coverage? That might be the byproduct?” Camerota asked.
“Well, yes. I think that’s fair,” Chaffetz responded. “But we’re just now consuming this. So, more of the analysis has to happen.”
UPDATE: During a subsequent appearance on Fox News, Chaffetz acknowledged his suggestion that American forego smartphones for health insurance perhaps wasn’t the ideal message for the morning after Trumpcare’s introduction.
“Well, what we’re trying to say, and maybe I didn’t say it as smoothly as I possibly could have but, people need to make a conscious choice. And I believe in self-reliance, and they’re gonna have to make those decisions,” Chaffetz said. “We want people to have access to an affordable health care product — if they have a preexisting condition, if they’re healthy, it is smart to go do it.”

Chaffetz did acknowledge that “we want people to have their communication equipment too,” but said “as an American, you gotta make choices… and as an adult, you get to make those decisions and live by those consequences.”

Insurance Just Got a Lot Sweeter

GC’s enthusiasm for the insurance technology sector is rooted in a belief in the power of insurance as a financial service for smoothing out losses in times of hardship. While the sector accounts for nearly 10% of Fortune 500 companies, the overwhelming majority of incumbents were founded not just pre-internet, but before the advent of modern digital computing. Smartphone ubiquity and continuous connectivity are new laws of nature, providing opportunity to provide consumers and businesses alike with better product experiences that are both long overdue and deserved. This includes changing how companies interact with customers, how policies are priced and purchased, and how claims are submitted and processed.

Our early explorations of the insurance sector led to our Series A investment in Oscar, a modern health insurance carrier driven by the principles of transparency, accessibility, and technology to improve customer satisfaction and drive down the cost of care. Since then, we’ve been active in learning and investing in the insurance sector more broadly, backing Gusto (SMB), TrueMotion (auto) and FreeBird (travel).
Along the way, we’ve had our eyes on the personal property & casualty market. While the auto insurance vertical has strong direct to consumer brands like Geico and Progressive, when it comes to protecting homes and everything inside them, the majority of the $85B in policies sold in the U.S. each year are still done offline by agents — as they’ve been sold for generations.

It was during this exploration that we met Daniel and Shai from Lemonade. And what they showed us was remarkable. For starters, it looks nothing like an insurance product. Instead of filling out forms and speaking on the phone with agents, Lemonade users engage in text-based conversation with “Maya”, an unbelievably quick, responsive, and helpful representative. If you live in NYC, where Lemonade is licensed to sell insurance, you can get your home covered in a matter of minutes. And, the claims process is just as zippy. Unlike the typical insurance experience, you’ll want to tell your friends about it; it is that painless.

As beautiful and magical as Lemonade’s web and mobile products feel, what impressed us more was the company’s rethinking of the economics of insurance under the hood. Insurance claims are made in moments of economic hardship, a time the consumer needs its insurance company the most. Since carriers’ profits are tied to the amount of payouts they make (when pooled premiums in a given year exceed the money the insurance company pays out in claims), tension exists at the heart of this relationship. To help conjure up a new way of doing business, Daniel and Shai recruited renowned behavioral economist, Dan Ariely. Together, they found that the answer lies in community and trust.
Just prior to completing an insurance policy, Lemonade customers identify a charity or cause that they care about. At the end of a given year, Lemonade reviews the claims made by the collective customers behind each cause-affiliated group. If the premiums exceed the claims (which they are expected to do), Lemonade returns what’s left as a “giveback” to the chosen cause. This results in more accurate claims since Lemonade customers are incentivized to help the causes they care about. Consumers act more responsibly, claims expenses are reduced, and more capital is sent to the cause of choice. Instead of making money off of underwriting profits, Lemonade simply takes a flat administrative fee for facilitating the program.
From Lemonade’s blog: “At Lemonade, we’ve designed a different business model. Since we take a 20% flat fee up front for our profits and expenses, whatever we don’t pay out in claims does not get put into the bank. We can’t. It’s not our money. It belongs to the charities and causes our customers choose.”
In an industry as highly regulated as insurance, “new ways of doing business” are not easy to execute. But what struck us deeply about the Lemonade team was that difficulty is a secondary variable in their calculus. Their true north is the customer, accepting the responsibility for finding creative strategies to pull it all off. This meant careful work with regulators, innovative company structuring, hard work in capitalization (both regulatory and operational), opening up new channels for customer acquisition, and more. In unchartered territory, they are not afraid to be the first in blazing a trail and are not phased by pushing the realm of possibility.
We are thrilled to back Daniel and Shai and welcome them and the extended Lemonade team to the GC family.

Trump economic head: Whether millions have insurance is ‘interesting’ but beside the point
National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn says how many people lose health coverage is really only about headlines.
Chris Wallace interviews Gary Cohn CREDIT: Fox News Sunday
Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace grilled Gary Cohn, the Trump administration’s National Economic Council director, about the millions of people slated to lose their health insurance coverage under the Trumpcare proposal on Sunday. After a lot of dodging, Cohn said the number of people who are insured is “interesting” but beside the point.
Wallace noted the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO)— which is lead by Congressional Republicans’ handpicked economist — is expected to release an analysis that finds the Trumpcare proposal would mean between “6 and 15 million people” losing their health insurance coverage. “Will the president support a bill that sends millions of Americans off insurance?” Wallace asked.
Trump’s top economic adviser initially ignored the question, criticizing the Affordable Care Act as “not working” and the Congressional Budget Office’s previous scores (under a different director) as “meaningless.” Wallace repeated the question.
“The numbers of who’s covered and who’s not covered,” Cohn replied. “That’s interesting and I know that may make some headlines, but what we care about is people’s ability to get healthcare and people’s ability to go see their doctor.”
Wallace noted that coverage “is really important if you lose it” and showed a 2015 clip of Donald Trump as a candidate vowing to “take care of everybody,” even if it cost him votes.
Cohn answered that under Trumpcare, everyone would be offered coverage. He added that the administration does not think anyone will lose insurance at all, and suggested that the plan’s end of the Medicaid expansion would not actually mean cost anyone their Medicaid coverage. He also claimed that because the people buying insurance on exchanges with subsidies would receive less generous tax credits instead, they will all have the opportunity to buy insurance if they want it.
Watch:

Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who as House Budget Chairman in 2015 selected the head of the CBO, made similar claims Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press. Price claimed, contrary to all evidence, that “nobody will be worse off financially in the process that we’re going through, understanding that they’ll have choices that they can select the kind of coverage that they want for themselves and for their family, not [that] the government forces them to buy.”

Set this Health Insurance Garbage on Fire
An insider’s calm, moderate response to a crisis
Getting On
Many people who work for a living have the sense that we’re racing to pay our bills or save up for something we need. We blame this “not-enough-ness” on rising expectations, or inflation, or poor spending habits, or the ups and downs of the market; or we bash Millennials, or whatever. But our entire economy has a rock tied to a rope and looped around its throat, and the rock is health insurance.
Health insurance is actually at the core of the growing income inequality in the US. If we don’t make a drastic change, the average family will pay more for their healthcare than their take-home pay by around 2030. I’m not talking about the total cost of your healthcare, I’m talking about the amount taken out of your check plus the amount you pay in co-pays and other hidden fees. Your paycheck: gone.
I’m so glad the market is taking such good care of us.
The Costs
I have been in the position of having to pay more for healthcare than I earned. About 12 years ago, after my son was born and I was in grad school, my paycheck would have completely disappeared if I had bought benefits for us through my employer. I went to the “free market” and found no affordable options there either. Luckily, my family was poor enough that my son and I were able to qualify for the state-provided plan. But many struggling people are too “wealthy” to qualify for many subsidized programs, even if all their money has gone to their health insurance provider. For example, even in states with expanded Medicaid programs, you must make $16,000 or under to qualify for this very low-cost or free coverage.
We may not be able to fathom intellectually how much of our cash goes to healthcare, though we feel it when we go to the ATM or pay bills. The reason why it’s hard to grasp is because health insurance companies intentionally make this so complicated that the only option is to not think about it in order to stay sane. The complexity is part of a larger plan to keep usage down, as is the way we are often denied benefits on the first attempt to get them. If we let ourselves know this, our heads would explode (not a coverable injury under your plan, by the way — sorry).
In our own paychecks, there are several helpful ways that the cost of healthcare is divided off so that we don’t lose our collective minds. We see how much we pay for insurance if we examine our pay stub in detail, but we don’t, because we have so few alternatives or real decisions to make.
For example, on my pay stub, there are separate listings for my dental plan ($11.72 per biweekly pay-period), my Health Savings Account ($166.66 of my money, put into a separate account I use to pay for medical bills, that is supposed to give me a tax benefit and also “train me” to be a wise healthcare consumer, but is actually a huge amount of work to use), health insurance premiums ($228.56), and a vision plan ($8.23). This set-up presents a series of sorta-small numbers, but you never get a big total bill unless you get out the calculator. Per month, I pay a “premium” of $497.02 for family coverage of bodies plus extra for our eyeballs and mouths, or about $5,964.24 per year. That premium is like the baseline before all the extras get added.
Lest you think I’m getting a great deal, rest assured: I have a cheaper plan because it has a much higher deductible, which is the money one has to pay first at the beginning of every year before the insurance kicks in. I always use all the money in my HSA, and then some, which adds a total of another $4,000 to my spending. I’ve got all kinds of stuff wrong with me, plus some prescriptions get dinged for extra charges, so I spend about another $2,000 on supplements and chiropractic care that is “out of network” and outside of my deductible, which doesn’t count for my “in-network” deductible and is under my “out-of-network out-of-pocket maximum.”
It’s a little obtuse, this system of categories, and it costs me at least $11,964.08 per year. It won’t cover my kid’s braces, either.
Granted, it does cover stuff I need to stay alive. But I’m sick of saying “thank you for letting me live” to some company that is making money off of me. Being alive and getting medical care is a right, not a privilege.
The “Choices”
Even if we do examine and add up all the numbers, the horrifying thing is that there is very little we can do to alter our options within this system because our choices are rigged.
The first thing every HR person tells you is to be a smart shopper. You could weigh two options offered by your employer, if you’re lucky enough to have a job and then have insurance offered through your employer. And you should calculate all the costs and benefits. Here’s one good guide for comparing your health plans from Consumer Reports.
But it doesn’t matter much which choice you make, because across the board, employers are cutting options, changing plans to make them “less rich,” squeezing out benefits, narrowing provider networks, and passing more and more of the financial risk onto their employees. Much of the cost you pay for healthcare doesn’t actually show up on your pay stub but is instead taken from you in dribs and drabs as your deductibles get higher and your co-pays for office visits slowly balloon, at a rate that is more rapid than the total cost of healthcare over time. Our employers tell us this will help us learn to control costs, as if it’s our fault this system is such crap.
It’s not.
The Committees
I served on a committee for the last two years at my job, and this committee’s task was, in part, to negotiate benefits with my employer. I learned exactly how the game is rigged.
We asked to see all kinds of plan options, and at every turn, our employer consulted the experts, who assured us that “consumer-driven healthcare” and higher deductibles were the only way to bring down healthcare costs. During the previous year, changes to our plan — including having employees bear more of the cost but also including benefits education and cheap measures that made our employees healthier rather than just guilty, depressed, and confused — had actually resulted in a decreased overall cost to our employer.
Those big “wins” became irrelevant as soon as they were achieved. We asked to freeze healthcare premiums for a year while we investigated what had worked, and we were told no: healthcare was in crisis, and the only way forward was to take the next recommendation from the consultants.
What we learned is that there’s no such thing as a real “market” for plans, because employees themselves, even in a rare situation like ours where we potentially had access to conversations and data, don’t make the decisions about which plan to buy. Instead, our options shrink. Employers hear from healthcare consultants that Plan A or Plan B is the “best new way to contain healthcare costs,” and employers do whatever the consultants tell them. These consultants work at the behest and pleasure of the insurers.
What’s more, many of the options touted as healthcare trends are overly political. We were sent forwarded emails and newsletters from “free enterprise” institutes proclaiming that yet more draconian options like “private exchanges” which are supposed to be the ultimate dream in for-profit healthcare: your employer just gives you a lump sum of money, and you worry about how to pay for your own care. We worried that these exchanges didn’t have any data or real plans to back them up, and yet we had to listen to a presentation from our healthcare consultants assuring us that this was the next (unstoppable!) market-based solution to healthcare.
Healthcare costs are going to continue to rise, for a variety of complex reasons. Yet we were told that it was all the consumers’ fault, which is a classic blame-the-victim strategy. After leaving every single one of those benefits meetings, I felt unaccountably guilty for being mortal and having a body. The emergency of healthcare costs was all placed on the consumer in a very shame-based way; the story of healthcare is told in these meetings in terms of the supposedly poor choices of the healthcare consumer and their “overuse” of the system. Such “overuse” might exist, but the individual consumer gets no guidance about how to use their plan effectively.
Overall, the consumer is not to blame. The fact that the system continues to fail to control costs is an indication of its poor design. Here are some of the factors at fault.
Bad incentives. At every level, there is little incentive for providers to control costs. Providers work in a “fee-for-service” system that reimburses based on the quantity of care, which results in patterns of more expensive testing being done. Our care for complex diseases is poorly coordinated, resulting in duplication of testing. And preventative care for chronic diseases is hard to come by. Many health insurers operate as for-profit businesses, which makes them responsible not for providing care but for targeting consumers and designing plans that will result in a healthy profit margin. UnitedHealth, the nation’s largest insurer in 2014, made $10.3 billion in profits that year. Health insurance companies look to target the most profitable large accounts, so they engage in a process of “purging” unprofitable smaller accounts by raising fees. This means that, even under the ACA, many small businesses cannot afford to buy insurance for their employees.
Lack of competition. Now the bigger insurers have accumulated enough money to start buying up smaller firms, too. They eliminate their own competition, and that consolidation also has the effect of decreasing insurers’ incentives for lowering prices.
Prescription drugs. Insurers say that they need more and more money to function due to the rising cost of healthcare and specifically the escalating cost of prescription drugs. Indeed, the pharmaceutical industry’s influence over healthcare costs and even healthcare legislation is hotly contested (and scary). But the entire problem can’t be blamed on Big Pharma.
Insufficient government regulation. As a result of concerns over price gouging — insurers have a very captive market, after all — Congress instituted limits on price increases under the Affordable Care Act. An insurer gets fined if it doesn’t spend 80% of what it collects on costs related to providing actual medical care. (This is called the 80/20 rule.) But the limits aren’t sufficient. Since before the ACA went into effect, industry analysts predicted that the five major health insurance companies stood to profit immensely from the ACA thanks to new users that are driven to buy their plans, hikes in premiums for small businesses that are required to insure their employees, and the high ceiling on rate hikes.
Consultants. During my term on the committee at my workplace, we examined plan options and consultant reports. I learned the vocabulary and tried to talk back, to explain, in plain language, the effects of escalating healthcare costs on my family. Many of the proposals would have resulted in my earning less next year than I made this year. And in the end, we won a one-year reprieve on healthcare changes. But in the process, we saw the horizon for us: inevitable cuts and more extreme “market-based” approaches guaranteed to shift more and more of the costs to the employees over time.
I’ve been active in healthcare for a long time. I wrote a memoir about my efforts. In August, I’m headed up to the Connecticut State House to testify in a hearing, because my insurer, Aetna, has asked the state if it can raise its consumers’ rates an average of 27% next year. I’m not sure what my workplace’s rates would be, or whether this average includes my workplace, but it’s much too high in any case. For perspective, my raise for next year is estimated to be around 1.5%.
The fundamental problem is that healthcare does not work as a market. The way things are set up now, stockholders of for-profit insurance firms and pharmaceutical firms benefit from the wild escalation in healthcare costs, so I’m calling bullshit on their “concern” over the escalation.
A meaningful healthcare fix will have to be structural, not an effort to shame those who have, and use, benefits.
The Alternative
Healthcare “industry” experts say voters won’t consent to pay for a public system, but in 2016 the average family of four spends over $25,000 of their own money per year on healthcare. I would gladly continue to fork over that cash if it would go to something decent, like bricks for hospital walls or salaries for nurses. Anybody who complains that we shouldn’t switch away from a market-driven system because it’s too hard or would be too complicated has never actually lived in a human body with an illness on a limited income and with substandard insurance. Let the people who have been fighting for socialized medicine run the new system if the buffoons currently in charge aren’t sure how to begin.
We’re all getting sicker, too, because this shit causes stress and forces low-income people to avoid caring for chronic problems. We avoid medical care when the costs seem greater than the benefits.
And no, the Affordable Care Act sadly didn’t fix this, though I’m a fan of that legislation. What it did was begin to offer health insurance options for people whose coverage was unfairly much too expensive before. But it didn’t wipe the slate clean and start over. That is what we need to do.
Though there was huge support for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ “Medicare for all” campaign platform, the Democratic National Committee didn’t include that wording in their campaign platform. I hope whatever organization Sanders has promised to launch will continue to make noise, and anybody with a body who isn’t a pharma or insurance shareholder should sign on. At the personal level, right now, all we can do is to tell our friends that this is one game they shouldn’t feel guilty about losing — because we’re getting bled out.
I’ll be sitting in one of those ACA hearings next month, feeling all my medical issues aggravated by the stress of living under this current system, which taxes all of our bodies and minds in ways that are never figured into the cost/benefit equations. I’m eager to tell my insurer that if it needs a 27% rate increase in order to function, maybe it should consider getting out of this business and letting somebody else take over.

Demonetizing Insurance
Massive reductions in insurance costs are coming, along with a wave of disruption.
Traditionally, insurance premiums are determined by actuaries… a function of big numbers, statistics and probabilities.
That’s what you have to do when you don’t know what’s really going on.
You hope that the pool of insured individuals is big enough to account for the variation in your predictive model.
But exponential technologies — namely computation/digitization, artificial intelligence, machine learning, sensors, networks (especially social networks), and genomics — will change all of that.
This is a blog about the future of insurance…
Let’s dive in.
Disrupting Insurance
I have been advising and am a proud board member of a new company called Lemonade Insurance Company that is rebuilding the insurance model from the bottom up — it is the world’s first “peer-to-peer” (P2P) insurance company.
Imagine just 90 seconds to get insured, 3 minutes to get paid. Zero paperwork.
P2P reverses the traditional insurance model. They treat the premiums you pay as if it’s your money. With P2P, everything becomes simple and transparent. Lemonade takes a flat fee, pays claims really fast, and gives back what’s left to causes you care about.
This week Lemonade launched their service and announced that they’ve been licensed as a full-stack insurance carrier by New York State for homeowner and renter’s insurance.
The work they’ve been doing is brilliant, so I’ll be using them as a strong example of some of the following ideas.
Let’s talk about five exponential drivers of this upcoming insurance revolution…
1. Digitization
Fraud consumes as much as 38% of all the money in the traditional insurance system, inflating premiums by $1,300 and making the claims process protracted and unpleasant.
This happens because there is a lack of transparency in a largely analog (rather than digital) system with many humans in the loop.
If you could digitize the entire process — from signing up to submitting a claim — and give the insured individual full transparency over the status of their request, adding in automation and machine learning, you can dramatically reduce processing time and costs.
This is what Lemonade does at its core. “Technology drives everything at Lemonade,” said Shai Wininger, president and cofounder. “From signing up to submitting a claim, the entire experience is mobile, simple and remarkably fast. What used to take weeks or months now happens in minutes or seconds. It’s what you get when you replace brokers and paperwork with bots and machine learning. Zero paperwork and instant everything.”
2. Implications of Social Networks
Social networks will allow us to create true peer-to-peer insurance models.
Imagine finding a group of peers, who you trust and can vouch for, and coming together as a group to self-insure.
You skip the centralized, expensive middleman insurance carrier — instead, a technology stack (app, database, AI-bot) manages a decentralized network of people who pay premiums and file claims that the group approves.
This takes out an enormous percentage of the cost structure of traditional insurance. Instead of paying fees and insurance company salaries, your peer group will be able to decide what to do with the extra cash that wasn’t paid out.
At Lemonade, you actually have the option to donate underwriting profits to nonprofit organizations of your choosing. Their hope is to remake insurance as a social good, rather than a necessary evil.
3. Implications of Genomics
When talking about life insurance, it’s going to be difficult to ignore genomic data. Your DNA is your medical future. It’s predictive of what’s likely to inflict or kill you.
In 2008, a federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed to protect people from genetic discrimination in healthinsurance and employment. The law states, “Genetic discrimination is the misuse of genetic information.”
However, life insurance companies are exempt from GINA.
I imagine that, soon, groups with great genes will coalesce and self-insure.
It’s in their best interest to do so. You’ll be able to upload your genomics data and find others in your peer group that have similar or better risk profiles than you do…
For life insurance companies, I believe there is a beautiful alignment of incentives coming soon. These life insurance companies will use genomics information to help their clients stay alive longer.
Why? Because the longer they are alive, the more premiums they can pay…
4. Implications of Sensors
Sensors will allow insurance policies to be based on actual data (e.g. usage, health), rather than general heuristics and rules.
As an analogy, check out Progressive Insurance’s SNAPSHOT Automotive Sensor package — it’s a sensor you put in your car that tracks how well you drive. (Do you brake hard? Speed? Take high-speed turns?)
When your insurance policy is based on how you actually drive, rather than just your age, gender and what kind of car you own, safer drivers win.
Sensors will have the biggest impact on health insurance, as hundreds of new health sensors are coming to market in the next 5–10 years.
Sensors tracking healthy behavior such as how much you exercise andwhat you eat, will get you low insurance costs.
A number of health insurance companies are already using health sensors in their policies.
One notable company called Oscar uses technology to simplify the entire health insurance experience.
You can use their app to talk to a doctor and get prescriptions without leaving home.
They built an app that helps you keep track of your health history with a timeline and you can earn rewards for staying active with a free Misfit step tracker.
In the near future, with the peer-to-peer model, you’ll soon upload everything from what you eat to the number of steps you take per day, and find a group with similar health profiles and self-insure.
5. Implications of A.I. & Sensors
The car insurance industry is about to get disrupted in a huge way.
Every major car company is working on full or partial autonomy, and since these cars are projected to reduce accidents by up to 90%, these cars are the beginning of the end for car insurance.
On top of that, why would I need a car insurance policy if I never drive? Or if I don’t own a car?
Accounting firm KPMG predicts that the motor insurance market may shrink by 60% by 2040. I think that number is a serious underestimate.
There is certainly a looming legislative battle coming for auto industry and auto insurance stakeholders. Does liability fall on car manufacturers? “Drivers”? Software engineers? AI’s? It remains to be seen.
Whatever the case may be, insurance, across the board, is ripe for disruption.

If You Want Life Insurance, Think Twice Before Getting A Genetic Test
As genetic testing explodes, health insurers are banned from denying coverage based on results. The same doesn’t apply for life insurance.
BY CHRISTINA FARR
Jennifer Marie* should be an ideal candidate for life insurance: She’s 36, gainfully employed, and has no current medical issues.
But on September 15 last year, Jennifer Marie’s application for life insurance was denied.
“Unfortunately after carefully reviewing your application, we regret that we are unable to provide you with coverage because of your positive BRCA 1 gene,” the letter reads. In the U.S., about one in 400 women have a BRCA 1 or 2 gene, which is associated with increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer.
Jennifer Marie provided a copy of the document to Fast Company on the condition that she and her insurance company remain anonymous, as she is still hoping to appeal the rejection.

According to recent estimates, 55% to 65% of women who inherit a harmful BRCA 1 mutation will develop breast cancer by the age of 70. By contrast, 12% of the general population will be diagnosed with breast cancer. But the presence of the gene mutation is by no means a death sentence. Not everyone with the BRCA mutation develops cancer, and some informed patients seek highly effective preventative treatments to reduce the likelihood that they’ll ever get sick.
“Those who find out they have the mutation can drastically reduce their risk,” says Laura Esserman, a surgeon and breast cancer oncology specialist at UC San Francisco. “Knowledge is power.”

Artificial Intelligence Verticals (I): Insurance
I wrote a short piece some time ago on how AI is going to affect the insurance industry. Now I want to dig a bit more into that.
Image Credit: Omelchenko/Shutterstock
I. A bit of background
The insurance sector is one of the most old-fashioned and resistant-to-change space, and this is why AI will have a greater impact on that with respect to more receptive industries. The collection of data of new types (i.e., unstructured data such as reports, images, contracts, etc.) and the use of new algorithms are disrupting the sector in several ways.
Traditionally, an insurance company followed this type of process:
Identifying pool of customers whom might be risk-assessed;
Targeting those customers and assessing the risk for each class;
Selling differently priced policies spreading the risks over the pool of customers;
Try to retain those customers as long as possible offering lower price for longer contracts.
This is a really simplistic representation of the insurance business in the last fifty years, and I am aware that insurance experts might disagree with me in many different ways. There are a couple of further features to be pointed out: first of all, insurance has historically been sold not bought, which means that brokers and agents were essential to tracking new customers and to even retain old ones. In addition, it is an industry which is by definition rich of data because they collected anything they could, but is also one of the less advanced because either many of those data are unstructured or semi-structured, or the model used are quite old and simple.
Most of those data were easy to obtain because they were required to correctly price the coverage, while additional complimentary data were provided only by good customers who had incentives in providing as much data as possible to get a cheaper policy. Of course, this works the other way for bad customers, and this is a perspective on the phenomenon of “adverse selection” (i.e., bad customers are going to ask an insurance because they feel they will need it).
The adverse selection issue is though only one of the intrinsic challenges of the sector: strong regulation, high level of fraud attempts, and complexity are other features any incumbents should take care of. It is interesting to notice though that some of those are also specific barriers to entry for startups: they might attract indeed people who normally can get affordable insurance with a bigger competitor (adverse selection) and they usually have the capabilities for breaking down the risk complexity but not to support the funding need for risk coverages (so they need to work with incumbents rather than trying to replace them).
In spite of those problems, in the last decade, we noticed a new trend emerging. Insurances, in the effort of trying to reduce moral hazard problems, they started offering premium discounts to their final customers in order to get extra information. This occurred either through a questionnaire (asking directly the customer for further data in exchange for a lower price) or indirectly through devices (healthy devices, black boxes, etc.). The real issue though has been the engagement side of this proposal, because of the opposite nature of information, rewards, and human nature. The rewards offered were indeed either temporary or provided only once and people got lazy very quickly, while the information stream needed to be constant.
The following step has been the introduction of apps to let customers monitor by themselves their own data and behavior, sometimes even given away for free the device itself. Leaving the customer with full power on his data had though an inverse effect, because people did not have the motivation in tracking down their improvements, and they got upset at the same time because they felt they were not getting the most out of that opportunity.
Regardless of the specific innovative way in which insurers engaged customers, the process used in the insurance business did not change much in the past century. Expert systems and knowledge engineering dominated the sector setting the rules to be followed in internal workflows, but this is slowly changing with intelligent automation systems. We are actually migrating from rule-based decision systems to statistical learning and eventually machine learning.

II. So how can AI help the insurance industry?
AI is helping (or disrupting, depending on how you see the matter) the sector in different ways. First of all, it can help increasing the customer engagement and retention problem which has been just mentioned. The abundance of data can be used indeed to refine the customers’ segmentation and provide personalized offers based on personal features. It also helps in reducing the costs through smart automatization or RPA (robotic process automation).
Second, AI is making people more aware of the risks as well as habits, and it is driving them toward better behaviors.
Furthermore, the better pricing and risk assessment that AI is introducing analyzing more granular data will make some people uninsurable (i.e., too risky to be fairly priced and covered) as well as to turn back some previously uninsurable people into insurable customers again. The governments or central regulatory agencies should then start thinking about a “pricing/risk threshold” in which they intervene subsidizing the cost of relevant insurances (e.g., basic health coverage) in order to “guarantee the uninsurables”.
Finally, it might be useful to think in terms of what an insurable risk is in order to see how AI can help with that.
According to Jin Park (Assistant Professor at IWU), an insurable risk is identifiable through the following five conditions:
Large number of similar exposure units (mutuality);
Accidental and unintentional loss (not predictable and independent from the insured customers);
Determinable and measurable loss;
Calculable chance of (not catastrophic/systemic) loss;
Economically feasible premium.
AI is going to affect all those features: with a better and more detailed customer profiling, we won’t need indeed to have such a large base of insured units. It will turn some frequent events into accidental (e.g., affecting drivers’ behavior it will reduce the basic accidents into rare events) and it will improve our ability to forecast and compute both the probability and magnitude potential losses even in those cases too hard to be managed before. All the previous improvements will make many more premium under budgets, and therefore the conclusion is that AI will “lower” the threshold of what we consider nowadays an insurable risk, and it will make then more risks insurable.

III. Who are the sector innovators?
There are plenty of startups out there working at the intersection of AI and insurance, and it essential to look at least at some of them to understand the future direction of the industry, as well as the kind of improvements AI is having in the insurtech space. An interesting thing to notice is that most of the innovation is happening in the UK rather than other countries, in all the segments proposed below.
Claim processing: Shift Technology skims the valid claims from the ones that deserve further validations; Tractable instead is trying to automatize experts task for insurances; ControlExpert has a specific focus on car claims; Cognotekt optimizes internal business processes, as well as Snapsheet does; Motionscloud offers instead mobile claim management solutions; and finally RightIndem aims to help insurers to deliver on-premise smoothing the claiming flow.
Virtual Agents & Chatbots: Spixii is an automated insurance agent who helps you buying any insurance coverage you might want; Cognicor is a virtual assistant that offers customer care services; Conversica identifies which leads intend to purchase, while Your.MD is a personal health assistant that analyzes symptoms and produces pieces of advice. MedWhat instead uses EMR (medical records) to assist the patient as it was a virtual doctor, and Babylon gives medical advice taking care of tight budget constraints. Insurify is another personal insurance agent who works as a comparator for car insurances.
What today is called simply chatbot is going to be renamed in a few years robo-insurer. There are already few examples of companies toward that goal: Risk Genius is indeed an intelligent comparator which identifies gaps in coverage for the customer and PolicyGenius looks for the best solution that fits customer’s needs and characteristics, while Drive Spotter implements real-time video analytics to keep drivers safe(r). More generally, robo-insurers will be a quite wide class of agents who will end up providing different services, all of them with the final goal of helping the clients to undertake risk-mitigating actions and only cover the real (residual) risks.
Customers engagement: Oscar is probably the most successful insurtech company out there, with the final goal of making insurance simple and accessible to everyone through a great UX. Similar to Oscar is somehow Stride Health, while Brolly is a tool that helps customers in understanding their own needs and facilitates in one place all the insurance coverages in place, in a similar fashion to Knip. Adtelligence instead creates personalized offers and relevant products based on customer’s characteristics. Captricity uses machine learning to convert handwritten files into structured data, and this can be used to better understand the final customer. Finally, ValChoice ranks the service of insurers to the benefit of the client.
Telematics: connected cars and telematics is a pretty big area itself (see CBinsights article to know more about it), but it would be worthy to point out the work that Greenroad, Vnomics, and Telogis are doing in capturing driving behaviors and habits as well as computing fuel efficiency. Cambridge Mobile Telematics works similarly, although it uses smartphone data and mobile devices habits. Navdy is trying to revolutionizing the UI/UX within vehicles, displaying information in such a way that the driver does not get distracted. Lytx uses vision technology to provide real-time feedbacks to the driver.
Underwriting: AI can be (and actually is) used to spot out hidden correlations to granularly segment customers and risks in a more efficient way. Even though it might in theory possible to identify some algos that could perform better than others (see the work Wipro did for fraud detection), data always come first, at least for the next close future. Many companies operate in the space, as for instance Carpe Data that provides predictive algorithms and data products for property and casualty and life insurances through the analysis of public data (e.g., social media data). Atidot created a machine learning risk management platform, while Tyche uses unstructured data to optimize the underwriting and claims process. Big Cloud Analytics collects data from wearables and formulates health scores for a better risk assessment, while Cape Analytics uses computer vision techniques on geospatial data to improve the level of detail on current houses conditions. Dreamquark creates a more accurate representation of the medical datasets to be used for underwriting purposes by insurances, similarly to FitSense that offers also apps products. Melody Health Insurance provides also low-cost insurances, while Uvamo uses AI to assess the risk of policy applications. A more accurate underwriting can even translate into covering events that are today quite risky (e.g., as MeteoProtect and Praedicat, and are doing for weather risk management).
Finally, on a side, it is worthy to point out to pure technological enablers as Instanda, which offers a management tool to the insurance providers to manage effectively and timely new products launched; Insly, a cloud-based platform for insurance brokers; and finally, SimpleInsurance is instead an e-commerce provider for product insurances.
P2P insurance: Lemonade, Friendsurance, and Guevara are peer-to-peer insurance startups focusing respectively on property and casualty insurance the first two, and car insurance the latter one.
Insurchain & Smart Contracts: these are companies in the insurance sector that are driven by blockchain technology. Elliptic offers real-time AML for bitcoin specifically, while Everledger is a permanent immutable ledger for diamond certification. Luther Systems is instead a stealth-mode company working on the standardization of smart contracts. Dynamis provides a P2P supplementary unemployment insurance product, while Saldo.mx provides micro-insurance policies on the blockchain. SafeShare covers multiple parties with insurance cover at short notice and for varying periods, and finally, Teambrella is another P2P insurance platform run on the blockchain.
Insurance on-demand: this class of startups put in customers’ hand the entire insurance buying process. Trov is probably the best example of this new class of players and it allows to ensure things by simply taking a picture of them. Cuvva is quite similar but with a focus on car insurance, Sure and Airsurety on travel policies, and Back me up is another example of on-demand insurance. But this class does not include only the proper on-demand business model, but also insurance startups which provide products that vary by location, time, use, or customer. In other words, pay-per-mile business model (Metromile), micro-insurance policies (Neosurance), or eventually Insurance-as-a-service models (Digital Risks).
IV. Concluding Thoughts
Yan identifies four elements which constitute the insurance profit structure: premium earned and the investment income from one hand, and underwriting cost and claim expenses from the other. AI is and will be able to improve the cost structure, increasing at the same time the competitiveness and enlarging the customer base accessible to insurers, while optimizing internal processes and enhancing the transparency and robustness of the compliance flow.
The greatest challenge I still see in insurance is the cultural mindset which might prevent insurance to adopt early AI solutions, although this won’t probably have a long life given the incredible pressure to innovate the insurance providers are undergoing through.

5 Ways That Insurance Will Be Disrupted By The Blockchain

I have been thinking a lot about how the Blockchain will disrupt different aspects of the economy and was recently asked about how it might impact the insurance space. My answer is that the Blockchain is about to enable the next generation of insurance.
There are a lot of interesting innovations in the space: Crowdfunding insurance, P2P insurance, On-demand insurance. We are excited about the fourth innovation in the space which is how the blockchain helps push insurance forward. I got input from a few of our companies on how they feel this will play out and this is what was discussed. So thank you Karen Hsu of BlockCypher and Hannah Kim of Mifiel.
“Smart contracts powered by the Blockchain could provide customers and insurers with the means to manage claims in a transparent, responsive and irrefutable manner.” — Deloitte’s Blockchain Report
The Blockchain was intended to do one thing: replace third party trust with mathematical proof. This process of replacing trust, ends up being very valuable, especially when thinking globally.
1. Reduce Fraud and Liability associated with immediate payments
Immutable ledgers are great for reducing fraud risk, and specifically for immediate payments, whether for claims or other, will be a huge value add to the industry.
2. Digital Claims Management (Track status of claims real time)
Imagine being able to verify the status of a claim in real time. The insurance companies would not have to put that information in an exposed database. This would be very valuable for hospitals, the police and other third parties who might need to look up information.
3. Automate payments with smart contracts
Reduce liability by automating claims with smart contracts, I think that this concept is far out, because smart contracts are still in the nascent stages, but it could be incredibly powerful.
4. Digital Wallets and identity management
A lot of people bring up identity management as a huge opportunity. The ability to prove someone is who they say they are online, but in the insurance world this could be a huge financial incentive to make it work. Their can be more accurate risk assessments and less fraudulent claims.
5. Cyber Liability
No corporation wants to get Edward Snowden(ed). He was able to modify the internal records to disguise what he was doing. With an immutable record of logs, the ability to change the record becomes impossible. Real time auditing can remove any cyber liability.
And many more…

Trumpcare could cost 24 million people their insurance, government analysis finds
The Congressional Budget Office just released its much anticipated report. Republicans were right to be scared.

The Congressional Budget Office released its long awaited analysis of Trumpcare on Monday afternoon, and its findings were grim.
The CBO found that 14 million fewer Americans would be insured by 2018 under the House GOP’s health care plan. By 2026, a full 24 million people would have gone uninsured relative to the number of people expected to be insured under the Affordable Care Act. The increase stems mostly from Trumpcare’s repeal of the individual mandate and changes to Medicaid.
The House GOP’s plan would get rid of the individual mandate that requires all Americans to sign up for health insurance, and would instead introduce a provision requiring continuous coverage. If anyone tries to go without insurance for two months or more, they would be required to pay 30 percent more on their premiums once they resumed coverage. Health care experts say this won’t be enough to keep healthy people in the market.
These are the people who will suffer under Trumpcare
Women, low-income people, and the elderly will all feel the effects of the American Healthcare Act.thinkprogress.org
The plan would also phase out Medicaid expansion and restructure how the program is funded. Health care experts also say they are concerned that tax credits won’t benefit low-income people the way they did under the ACA, and that things like health savings accounts won’t be enough to help the Americans who need help the most. Overall, low-income people, women, people with chronic illnesses, and people with mental health issues would suffer the most under this plan.
The CBO also projected that premiums would be 15 to 20 percent higher overall in 2018 and 2019. The cost would start to decline in 2020, but older enrollees would still pay substantially higher premiums than young people, because insurers would be permitted to charge then five times as much. Under the ACA, insurers can only charge older people up to three times more than younger people.
Republicans on the Hill and in the Trump administration, perhaps anticipating a report with these findings, started casting doubt on the CBO’s accuracy well before Monday’s report came out.
“So I love the folks at the CBO, they work really hard, they do, but sometimes we ask them to do stuff they’re not capable of doing, and estimating the impact of a bill this size isn’t the — isn’t the best use of their time,” Mick Mulvaney, President Donald Trump’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, told ABC News on Sunday.
The CBO estimated that enacting Trumpcare would reduce the federal deficit by $337 billion over the 2017–2026 period. There would be a $1.2 trillion reduction in outlays, with the largest savings coming from changes to Medicaid and the elimination of the ACA’s subsidies for non-group health insurance. There would a reduction of $880 billion in federal outlays for Medicaid.

Lessons From the Front Lines of Insurance Tech Innovation in China
Co-authored by Ankur Nandwani and Christopher Kelvin Lee

“A healthy society should not be full of stock investors, but policyholders.” — Jack Ma
Hoopla around insurance technology in the U.S. is heating up as startups look to re-imagine how insurance is bought, productized, and experienced across small commercial, life, personal property coverage, and more. Still, the insurance tech space as a whole is at an early stage and a host of exciting startup innovation either remains under wraps or is just now getting off the ground. 
 
Meanwhile, activity in China to date has proven to be incredibly dynamic. Familiar macro-conditions, such as 1.4 billion citizens, 700 million+ Internet users, and massive distribution effects driven by WeChat and Alipay are at play, but China also features a few factors ultimately leading to a more exciting environment for insurance innovation. This includes:
 
A generally supportive regulatory environment (so far): The China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) has been aggressive to both acknowledge and encourage innovation around new insurance products and online distribution on a national level at least so far, while barriers to entry in the U.S. are controlled by state insurance commissioners, which are appointed by the new governor coming into office in 39 out of 50 states. 
 
A massively underserved market opportunity. While China is set to advance past Japan as the world’s second largest insurance market with a rapidly growing segment of online insurance buying, overall insurance penetration in China ranks just 49th among nations and 18 times lower than penetration in the U.S. as measured by premium vs. GDP. This is a significant mismatch as the U.S. GDP per capita is only 4 times greater than China. Ultimately, U.S. players have to deal with saturation and struggle to find an edge in the value chain; whereas in China, both domestic insurance carriers and new startup insurers encounter greenfield opportunities to find growth and profitability at scale.
 
A leading role by Internet giants. Third, the largest Internet companies in China — Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and Jingdong (BATJ) — are all aggressively staking out their place in how the country’s digital insurance landscape will shake out — in contrast with the unsubstantial role Facebook, Google and Amazon have taken to date in the U.S. The unique distribution and data advantages of these major players could help to rapidly accelerate the growth of the overall industry in China and shift the landscape as they or their financial services affiliates launch licensed online insurers across product lines.
We organize this overview into the following parts:
Insurance Regulation and Market Conditions in China
Zhong An: The World’s First Dominant Online Insurer
Lessons through Product Walkthroughs
Key Takeaways & Open Questions
1. Insurance Regulation and Market Conditions in China
Regulators seem keen on the opportunities of insurance tech innovation in China (for now)
 
Chinese insurance regulators, namely CIRC, are aware of the rise of digital insurance in China. More importantly, a number of early developments suggest that regulators are also meaningfully supportive of how technology will influence the growth of insurance in China. Some of these developments include:
 
 More online insurance carrier licenses 
 
Last July, CIRC approved licenses for three additional online insurers, Yi An Property Insurance, Anxin Property Insurance, and Taikang Online Property Insurance, with products including investment-linked insurance (Taikang), medical expense insurance (Yi An) and online payment insurance (Anxin). As one source close to CIRC said on the approvals, “The approvals given one after another by CIRC to three Internet insurance companies is line with the overall government drive to promote Internet business, which is developing very rapidly.” 
 
That’s not to say that regulators won’t change their tone toward nascent online insurers or haven’t done so already. It’s quite possible that the influx of new online-only licenses by CIRC was a one-time phenomenon or a rare instance of leniency. Many more are waiting. One Chinese insurance executive told us there are more than 200 companies including new online insurers waiting in the queue for a license as of August.

The first set of online insurance regulations enabling scale 
 
In the same month, CIRC released its first set of “Internet Insurance Measures”, which took effect in October 2015 to regulate emerging online insurance businesses in China. We won’t re-iterate the full list here, but the new regulation stipulates that insurance firms may provide online insurance services in locations where they do not have physical presence, which allows new insurance products enabled for the Internet economy to launch nationwide soon after CIRC filing. Worth noting that this does not apply to mature insurance products in China including auto insurance, which requires provincial regulatory approval.
 
Chinese insurers being driven closer to startups
 
Those in the U.S. and Europe involved in the insurance tech ecosystem might be familiar with three-year old Zhong An Insurance, whose four billion policies sold can prompt shock and awe. But it’s important to mention that market share in both life and P&C in China are dominated by the largest domestic players. In 2014, the top 3 life insurers accounted for nearly half of all life insurance premium income in China; in total, the top 10 life insurers accounted for nearly 82% market share. Within P&C, market concentration has increased even further. The top 5 non-life insurance companies accounted for a whopping 75% of premium income in 2014, while the top 10 made up 86% market share.

And as U.S. and Europe-based insurers have, those same domestic insurers may soon becoming more active across the startup landscape. According to a statement coming after a cabinet meeting led by Li Keqiang in September 2016, state-owned companies, which include insurers like China Taiping and China Life, will be allowed to set up venture funds and “insurance companies will be encouraged to invest in startups.”
 
Chinese insurers and other strategics have already been involved in the financing of insurance startups globally; notably, U.S. per-mile car insurance startup Metromile recently disclosed a $50M investment from China Pacific Insurance Group and Fosun, the owner of Yong’an P&C Insurance in China, recently made an investment in mobile insurance claims company Snapsheet. We can expect to see more tech or online insurance-focused investments or joint ventures by Chinese insurers both domestically and abroad.
 
Still early days
 
Of course, it would be remiss to ignore that regulation around insurance innovation in China is still incredibly nascent — and may eventually play out significantly differently than the current environment. Consider that online insurance sales platform Datebao.com became the first Internet insurance startup to receive a national broker license in only November of last year.
 
We can look to prior regulation for guidance. In 2014, for example, China’s banking and insurance regulators released stringent bancassurance guidelines and earlier this year, an overhaul of the fund management industry resulted in a culling of 10,000+ private fund managers. In China, startups and online insurers that are able to grow into massive scale will always face the possibility of regulators taking a more draconian approach.
 
China’s Internet giants have had mixed success (and strategies) on the regulatory front to date. Bai An Insurance, the joint venture of Baidu, Hillhouse Capital and Allianz, was announced with much fanfare in November 2015, but has yet to receive full approval by CIRC likely due in part to negative press regarding the role of Baidu ads in a student’s death from cancer. Meanwhile, Ant Financial decided a faster route to obtaining a license would be to acquire an existing Chinese insurer (Cathay), which it did in September 2015.
 
And in May, CIRC issued a formal warning against mutual aid platforms, a significant area of startup growth, as they may “lack actuary-based pricing systems, provision against risks and strict supervision by government bodies.”
New demand for new insurance products
Insurance in China traces its roots as far back as 1805 when the British East India Co. set up operations in Guangzhou. But China as an insurance market only really started in the 1980s and only formally opened up to the outside world and foreign insurers in 1992.
That was then and this is now. In 2016, China is reportedly set to surpass Japan as the world’s second largest insurance market, with premium income growing 37% year-over-year to hit $287.9 billion in the first six months of the year, according to the CIRC. Within China, life insurance today comprises nearly 70% of all insurance premium, while auto insurance is king when it comes to P&C making up around 3/4ths of all P&C premium. 
 
Unlike the U.S. where a host of venture-backed startups are looking to build new digital brands in homeowners and renters insurance (think Lemonade, Jetty, Hippo and others), homeowners insurance has largely been a non-factor in China P&C and fire insurance is no longer mandatory for mortgages after a wave of complaints around the bundled annuity and investment products insurers paired it with.

More exciting is how fast online insurance buying is progressing in China. This includes both online distribution of traditional insurance products like health as well as products enabling the rise of the Internet economy in China like Zhong An credit or shipping returns insurance. According to a June report from Ant Financial and CBNdata, around 330 million people in China have bought insurance policies over the Internet through March 2016, up 42% from a year ago. Among those buyers, a notable 33% were born since 1990s. 
 
Broadly, insurance companies in China, both large and small, still have to deal with a user demand challenge. Not only is mass consumer awareness of insurance needs still incredibly low, those who are insurance-conscious are skeptical of its value. As one insurance executive in China at a global P&C insurer said,
“Chinese who are 40 years old and in urban cities are beginning to have assets and lifestyles to protect. These consumers would rather trust their own savings rather than insurance companies.”
Change effected by both upstarts and Internet giants could soon feel sudden, though. Consider that insurance bought online in China represented just 5.2% ($21.4 billion) of total industry premium in the first half of 2016. That’s compared to 4.7% in the same period a year ago and 4.2% in the same period in 2014, according to the Insurance Association of China.

Tech giants are incredibly eager to capitalize on insurance
Another very notable difference between insurance tech innovation in the U.S. and Europe and that of China is just how engaged the largest Chinese Internet giants are in asserting their positions through M&A, joint ventures, investments and more. Yes, China’s online insurance market has grown immensely over the past two years, but the concentrated industry efforts by China’s major Internet companies, Baidu, Alibaba/Ant, Tencent and/or Jingdong (BATJ) will likely accelerate that growth substantially and may result is a very different looking insurance tech landscape in China in the years to come.
 
It’s worth noting that the strategic moves by BATJ vary considerably in their depth and breadth. Here’s an abbreviated rundown of how BATJ’s efforts have progressed:
 
Alibaba/Ant Financial: After launching Zhong An in collaboration with Tencent and Ping An in 2013, Ant has arguably been the most active of China’s Internet giants in carving out its position in the insurance industry. These moves span from health, where Alibaba collaborated with Taiping Insurance to form an online health insurer with registered capital of $154 million, to life, where Ant backed China’s first mutual insurance association approved by CIRC to P&C, where Ant took a controlling stake in Cathay Insurance China. With more than 120 million daily transactions on Alipay and many customers using the app more than 10x a year, Ant’s ultimate goal for its insurance products could be to leverage its unique data and distribution advantages to take on existing conglomerates like Ping An in size and scope, and in a fraction of the time and resources needed.

Baidu: Baidu has made a couple major announcements regarding its insurance ambitions including Bai An, its joint venture around scenario-based insurance with Hillhouse Capital and Allianz, which it describes as “small, situational insurance protection offered for high-frequency, location-based or internet transactions, including online travel and various online-to-offline (O2O) services.” Baidu also announced a joint venture with China Pacific in June 2016 to launch a new online auto insurance carrier.
 
While Baidu has some marked advantages in the insurance space namely its trove of search data where it claims the personal profiles of 100 million Chinese users, its efforts to date have been mired by its recent ads scandal as both of its insurance products have yet to get past CIRC. If CIRC’s spurt of new online licenses last year was indeed a one-time phenomenon, this would suggest Bai An may have missed its window of opportunity. 
 
Jingdong: Alibaba rival Jingdong through its affiliate JD Finance has also waded into the insurance industry. In October 2015, JD Finance reportedly signed strategic framework agreement with the Sichuan government to establish an online property insurer and as of March of this year was recruiting for dozens of insurance-related positions.
 
Tencent: Outside of its participation in Zhong An’s founding, Tencent’s most notable announcement in the insurance industry came in September 2015 when it announced Hetai Life, an online life insurance joint venture with CITIC Group and its first foray into life insurance. In August 2016, the Tencent joint venture received CIRC approval to prepare for launch, which will be interesting to monitor on the product front given its potential friction with Tencent’s enormous success with micro-transactions.
 
Ultimately, all four bring their own immense value to (possibly) forthcoming insurance products: Tencent in social, Ant in commerce and online business data, Baidu in search and Jingdong in logistics. Depending on how fast their initiatives develop, China’s insurance tech and even its overall insurance landscape could look incredibly different in a very short amount of time.
2. Zhong An: World’s First Dominant Online Insurer
Zhong An: First-mover advantage?
 
Before all of these strategic moves, of course, was the first notable foray by China’s Internet giants: Zhong An Insurance, which is a case study for insurance innovators in the U.S. and elsewhere in and of itself. 
 
In November 2013, Alibaba and Tencent, teamed up with Ping An Insurance to launch the country’s first online insurance carrier with registered capital of $164 million and the only license at the time from CIRC to sell insurance online.

The following month, Zhong An launched its flagship product, Zhonglebao, effectively acting as e-commerce returns insurance for China’s $1 trillion dollar online and mobile e-commerce market. It was aimed at covering merchant shipping losses on Alibaba’s Taobao marketplace when consumers are dissatisfied with product purchases. Over 1 billion policies were sold in the first year.
 
Fast forward to 2016 and Zhong An had written more than 4 billion policies to more than 400 million customers. The online insurer has since expanded its product line in auto, health, and travel, and as of its latest financing event, carries a private market valuation of $8 billion with reported plans to go public as soon as 2017. 
 
That’s not to say Zhong An is future-proof. Taobao shipping returns insurance, for example, accounted for 77% of its overall premium in 2014. While it hasn’t broken out the data since, it will need to show it can reduce its dependency on its powerful partners as it looks to test the public markets.
 
Aggressive B2B2C distribution strategy
 
The concept of a traditional retail agent with a storefront is not common in China and there was never as much of a need for these intermediaries. Chinese online broker Zhongmin has tried to open local shops to sell insurance products in addition to other financial products like loans, but such has not been a successful model. Instead, distribution in China and most of Asia has been done through outbound telemarketing (OBTM) by way of banks, telecom providers and supermarkets that obtain phone numbers. Auto insurance, for example, is mostly bought through telephone with a captive agent and many agencies are unqualified or have gotten in trouble for misleading marketing tactics. As of 2012, over 190,000 were part-time agencies. As we heard a few times, “The Chinese market is mature in digital channels, but immature in regular channels.”
 
Dynamics between startups and tech conglomerates in China, though, lend to a uniquely collaborative environment. Zhong An is able to deeply integrate with distribution partners at a level that many counterparts in the U.S. would drool about giving it the ability to hit a variety of targeted customers with its insurance offerings at critical inflection points. Today, Zhong An has 300+ partners across health, travel, auto, e-commerce, banking and more.

For a new U.S. tech company to partner with Amazon, eBay, Stripe, Facebook, Google, Priceline, Pinterest, Handy, Lending Club, and Apple…at the same time without channel conflicts…would be nearly impossible.
 
For Zhong An to do what it has done in the short amount of time is quite astonishing, and a hat tip is owed to the regulatory and entrepreneurial conditions in China today. For U.S startups, investors and others in the industry, there are more takeaways to glean.
 
Insurance MVPs attached at the hip to tech MVPs
 
Beyond partnerships, Zhong An’s product iteration cycle is massively scaled. With the support of major investors, they have the wherewithal to test and measure micro-transaction products at a magnitude expected of a Y Combinator batch. Back in 2015, they had publicly launched 100+ products, and today, they have announced over 200. Zhong An CFO John Bi noted at the recent InsureTech Connect conference that the online insurer can launch a new insurance product in the span of five to six weeks. 
 
Besides products, Zhong An has been deploying infrastructure at breakneck speed, experimenting with customizable employee insurance platforms, the equivalent of worker’s comp systems for the massive Chinese O2O economy, its own cloud data processing platform for carriers, and a Zhong An API to partner with new partners.
 
To do this, they have a supply chain of very experienced executives, product managers, developers, designers, actuaries, underwriters, risk managers, claims manager who work well together and have multiple years of experience at Google, Allianz, HSBC, Alibaba, Ping An, and CITIC Bank.
 
At a high level, the way they do this is by getting Ping An product managers in the same room with Alibaba product managers and telling them to innovate and compete. The sub units’ bottom line is the volume of policies, premiums, and customers they can achieve. Actuaries and underwriters are at play, but they are secondary to the primary goal: a consumer land grab.
 
One can postulate the strategy behind the decision: the current RMB payout on a parametric or indemnity loss are so low that they probably counterweigh potentially high customer acquisition cost (CAC) later down the road. In China, as we have seen with the Didi Chuxing-Uber roll-up, consolidation and customer acquisition is key to winning.
 
Can there be a Zhong An of the U.S.?
 
For U.S. startups who want to sell auto, home, life insurance through partnerships or an insurance API, the reality is a bit more difficult. Though Facebook Messenger has been working to implement WeChat functionality, the transactions around mobile in the U.S. is not as rich as it is in China.
 
Partnerships between Berkshire Hathaway Travel Insurance and Visa or between Wells Fargo Online and Assurant renters insurance are one-off, and not as effective. Established startups such as NerdWallet, SoFi, or Credit Karma are also trying to figure out insurance distribution out themselves. They need to figure out broker licenses, win carrier appointments, or find paper, while the carriers in the U.S. are utilizing their trove of proprietary data and new third party tech and data vendors. 
 
Depending on who you talk to within the insurance space, more or less everybody knows that UI/UX, rating, and claims processes have to be improved, intermediaries are needed regardless if they are traditional or a new startup, and data will be utilized. It is very likely that elements of Zhong An and other Chinese insurance tech upstarts will take a different form in the U.S., but there is still much to be gleaned for U.S. startups, investors and others in the insurance industry on the product innovation front.
 
Market enablers lead to product innovation
 
The major enabling factors we described at the beginning of this paper have already led to a substantial amount of experimentation in both insurance and quasi-insurance products. Here are a few from just Zhong An:
Merchant Performance Insurance (MPI) — Partnership with Alibaba to protect merchant performance and guarantee deposits on TaoBao via Zhonglebao.
Weather Insurance — Via T-mall and WeChat, insurance pays out to cover extra living costs for record high temperatures.
Mobile Phone Repair Insurance — Offers repairs to physical damages made to Xiaomi smartphones.
Mobile App Security Insurance — Partnership with Baidu to cover fraudulent transaction processed on Baidu Mobile Guardian app.
P2P Loan Guarantee Insurance — Protects P2P lenders from defaulting payments on leading platforms like Tongxin.
Credit Insurance — Credit insurance policy underwritten by Zhong An for users obtaining credit lines when shopping on the Chinese eCommerce platform Mogujie.
Flight Delay Insurance — Partners with leading OTAs (Ctrip, Qunar) to provide insurance products covering flight cancellation, delays, and accidental injury priced based on historical flight delay ratio and paid through WeChat wallet.
To an insurance insider in the U.S., many of Zhong An’s flagship ‘insurance’ products don’t fit the traditional, Western definition of insurance since there is no clear indemnity. MPI and the end product Zhonglebao function more as a merchant clearinghouse. Weather insurance can be construed as a Groupon-like lead into local vendors. Mobile repair insurance is similar to Asurion / AppleCare warranties to promote customer retention. Mobile app security insurance has no real analog in the U.S. besides PayPal / Lookout; and P2P loan insurance is basically unheard of in the U.S.
 
More constructive for those in the U.S. looking to learn from China’s insurance tech landscape is to dig into what these products look like themselves. We highlight a few below:
3. Lessons through Product Walkthroughs
To better understand the true inertia of change in China, it is best to understand the user experience of what Chinese consumers see after they discover a new insurance product through WeChat or other online distribution channel. We highlight a few select examples below, but it’s worth noting that these make up a tiny portion of companies in China’s insurance innovation landscape today.
 
Zhong An
 
Zhong An has taken the approach of looking at every source of data under the sun, finding unmet needs among Chinese consumers and then inserting themselves into the process. Today, Zhong An has three main business lines: 1/ traditional insurance products 2/ creative insurance products enabled by technology (i.e. critical illness insurance utilizing wearable device data) and 3/ insurance products for the Internet economy (i.e. shipping returns insurance). 
 
One example of this is Zhong An’s vaccine insurance product in which product managers identified a host of bad vaccination outcomes in the news, studied vaccination data released by the Chinese government, and offered a corresponding risk product. Moreover, Zhong An also integrated with WeChat and other distribution channels to offer its vaccination insurance product right at the point of booking an appointment, an optimal market entry.

Indeed, health insurance has been a major area where Zhong An has focused more of its attention on the product front. As the product flow below shows, Zhong An not only prompts users with free or discounted insurance offerings but much more, including the ability to record 60 to 80-second office exercise videos and track exercise status, thus keeping its customers engaged with multiple touch points a year that can create significant value through cross-sell opportunities for its other products.

Another way that Zhong An and other insurance companies are innovating within the health insurance industry is by offering what we call “tailor-made” health insurance policies. The main idea here is to offer an insurance policy that caters to a specific age group and a predetermined list of diseases and extending their interaction and touch points with the insured into the policy period by providing video apps to consult with doctors.
This is significantly different than in the U.S. where ACA standardizes health plans and caps profit margins, and federal regulators are penalizing non-standard health plans.

Zhong An’s account page highlights another aspect of how it aims to be a widespread enabler of the Internet economy by promoting multiple touch points with its product(s). For example, Zhong An has formed a point structure in which users who sign in daily earn bonus points. Zhong An’s aim of becoming a more comprehensive financial services provider is also apparent from its account page: its wallet currently features a product named YuanBao, in which employees can borrow money from a third-party lender with a borrowing guarantee from Zhong An.

OkChexian: Rethinking auto “insurance”
 
OkChexian is an auto insurance start-up based out of Shanghai, which bills itself as one stop shop for all car-related needs. In addition to offering traditional auto insurance, OkChexian offers quasi-insurance products like “car wash subsidy” and “traffic jam subsidy”, and products like “oil price guessing” that cater to the speculative behavior of Chinese customers. Rather than labeling these products as insurance, it has labeled them as a subsidy or discounts, which help it stay clear from the purview of insurance regulators.
 
Taken separately, it would have been hard to build a business around any of these product categories, but when taken together, OkChexian has been able to create a hook for auto insurance policies, which have a higher margin.

As the screenshot below highlights, OkChexian is able to obtain the real-time location of its users by tapping into smartphone sensors when enabling its trip management function. This dongle-free approach is in contrast to how Metromile has used its Pulse OBD-II dongle to power its per-mile insurance though is closer to other startups opting for a sensor-based approach to UBI like Zendrive or TrueMotion. 
 
Within the trip management function (shown below), OkChexian also promotes its “traffic jam subsidy” service, which offers users gas coupons if the app detects that users are indeed caught in traffic jams.
 
Users can also participate in a daily “oil price guessing” by betting on the oil price movement the following day, with coupons of differing size as prizes for participants who guess correctly. These products may seem incredibly far-fetched to tech entrepreneurs and investors in the auto insurance space in the U.S., but in China, OkChexian has already touched more than 2 million users with these products.


Datebao
 
Xishan Information Technology dba Datebao started off by providing an online brokerage for premium health insurance products at affordable prices, but has quickly evolved into one of the largest distributors of health insurance products in China with nearly 5 million users today.

A big part of Datebao’s growth can be attributed to its novel distribution strategies. From offering flash sales to Groupon-like deals on insurance, Datebao has leveraged various e-commerce marketing strategies to expand the reach of its insurance products, as shown below. The challenges for Datebao are two-fold: 1/ Though they have been successful in acquiring customers for one-time products, can they turn these users into higher-value customers and 2/ China’s healthcare infrastructure is still immature and might have difficulty supporting Datebao’s business model if it continues to scale.

Shuidihuzhu and the rise of mutual aid platforms
 
Today, there are at least four different ‘mutual aid’ platforms with over 1 million users in China. These quasi-insurance products aggregate members who pay small fees, which contribute to a larger pool that promises certain payouts if a member is subject to a given event (e.g. critical illness, car accident) and primarily draw new members via WeChat. 
 
As we previously highlighted, mutual aid platforms have been a target of CIRC already and were the subject of a press conference in April warning against such plans that “have no stable financing or sound insurance solvency because there is no risk assessment or policy rates determination that should be based on actuarial calculation and liability reserve funds.”
 
One of the fastest-growing mutual aid platforms in China is Shuidihuzhu, launched by a former executive of Chinese group-buying giant Meituan-Dianping. Shuidihuzhu features two products on its app, AD&D mutual aid and cancer mutual aid, the latter of which has scaled past 1 million users in less than half a year. For Shuidihuzhu, a critical insight was that many low or middle-income Chinese cannot afford critical disease insurance premiums that need to be paid each year. As the screenshots below highlight, the app encourages signup growth by transparently promoting both its membership base and fee structure breakdown (as low as 3 RMB).
 
Whether or not these mutual aid platforms can outlast regulators in achieving breakout scale is to be determined (and perhaps unlikely), but for now they offer an interesting look at how certain quasi-insurance products can fit in China’s ecosystem and scale at a rapid pace especially as various ‘peer-to-peer’ branded insurance models become a point of debate in the U.S. and Europe.



4. Key Takeaways & Open Questions
Every week, a quick scan of 36kr (China’s TechCrunch equivalent) highlights another headline-grabbing development in China’s exciting insurance innovation landscape. As Zhong An looks to potentially test the public markets, China’s dynamic insurance tech market will likely become more visible to U.S. operators, investors and insurance executives. 
 
With that in mind, here are a few key takeaways and open questions on how insurance innovation in China might evolve over time:
 
Will regulators clamp down? While tech companies innovating in the insurance industry have benefitted from China having just one centralized regulatory body, whether the spate of approvals for online-only licenses will continue or whether ancillary activity such as the rise of mutual aid platforms will persist in its current growth is still an open question. This is a key difference. Whereas startups in the U.S. are allowed to grow without fear that regulators will clamp down as long as they follow the rules, those in China face the possibility of getting routed by regulators if deemed to be growing too fast for comfort.
 
Can a true startup succeed in insurance? While Zhong An has grown rapidly since its founding, it benefits immensely from the joint resources of its founding partners Alibaba, Tencent, and Ping An. Meanwhile, BATJ is playing a winner-take-all game as they look to expand into every part of the daily lives of Chinese consumers as well as how they protect it. As one investment executive said to us, “That’s why you don’t see a big tech giant in China born after 2000. Almost all were born before 2000. This is quite different from the U.S. market.”
 
 While China is an exciting breeding ground for insurance innovation, it remains an open question whether the majority of value will continue accrue to China’s Internet giants vs. startups hoping to break through.
 
Enough trust? On Alibaba’s last earnings call, the health of the Chinese vs. American consumer was a major talking point as executives touted the Chinese consumer’s healthy balance sheet and ability to spend:
First, take a look at the Chinese consumer. Chinese households today have aggregate net cash reserves of over US$4.6 trillion. This accumulated wealth and liquidity is the result of real double-digit wage growth over the past decade. In contrast, in early 2008 on the eve of the global financial crisis, household debt in the United States was 98% of GDP, and the average American family was in heavy debt.
However, insurers and insurance innovators alike still need to develop a lot of trust among the average Chinese consumer. In a recent survey, half or more Chinese consumers who criticized an insurance brand within the past 12 months did so “because of a frustrating claims process that is too slow, is not transparent enough, falls short of the customer’s payout expectations, or requires too much effort from the customer.” The new breed like Zhong An is trying to solve this problem by streamlining the claims process through WeChat and Alipay and offering low value products with the hope that users will gradually migrate to traditional high value products.
 
These are just a few of the questions still open on how insurance innovation will develop in China moving forward. We have the full expectation that the pace of market dynamics can (and will) cause some companies or ideas discussed in this paper to accelerate incredibly quickly or bear out in entirely different directions as existing players deviate strategies, new ones enter the market, and/or regulators clamp down.
 
Of course, we’re eager to hear from you. If you have any questions, critiques or ideas about China’s digital insurance market that we’ve failed to ask or introduce, we welcome your feedback!

The Folly of Health Insurance Tied to Employment
Give portability a chance

Healthcare law in the United States is a confusing mess, and that was true before the latest political debacle of repeal and replace in which Republicans attempted to switch out the current broken scheme for one that was simply broken in other ways. This failure has been trending news for a week and there is no need for me to rehash it here.
There is, however, hope for a solution. The New York Times reports that neither repeal nor replace are dead. According to some, the Republicans’ failure last week was a result of combining repeal and replace. Now Republicans are going to take their time.
'Repeal and Replace' Becomes 'Repeal vs. Replace'
In the past few weeks, various articles summarizing Republican moves on health care have attempted to analyze the…www.nationalreview.com
Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, presented a promising outline for repeal and replace weeks ago in the vain hope of saving Republicans from their self-inflicted injury. His advice was not heeded, but it is worth revisiting now.
In “The Right Way to Repeal Obamacare” in Politico, Sen. Cruz offered the basics of his plan. After outlining a procedural strategy to seek repeal by relying on the 2015 repeal language overwhelmingly supported by Republicans, as well as adding the previously excluded insurance market regulations to repeal the entirety of Obamacare, he called for common sense reforms.
The Right Way to Repeal Obamacare
"Is Obamacare Republicans' Waterloo?" That was the question a reporter posed a couple weeks ago. It's the narrative…www.politico.com
Cruz is the rare legislator who recognizes that industries — healthcare included — do not require a 2,000 page monstrosity of a bill. (If the leglislators can’t absorb what they are voting for, how can we expect everyday citizens with livelihoods that do not allow for hours and hours spent pouring over insurance rules to manage their medical coverage?)
The proposed common sense reforms are: competitive and innovative insurance markets which are open across state lines and risk classes, health savings accounts, and portability.
Policy commentary often covers the advantages of competitive markets and the details of HSA’s. Here at Arc Digital yesterday, Ryan Huber started a series on healthcare. The first installment covered medical innovation costs and how high U.S. medical costs are partly a result of the U.S. subsidizing research for the rest of the world.
U.S. Health Care Reality Check #1: Pharmaceutical Innovation
Why does health care cost so much in the United States?arcdigital.media
Portability, however, gets short shrift. Americans are so used to our system of health insurance tied to our jobs that we hardly notice the oddity of having employers pay for employee health coverage. But it is odd.
(Bureau of Economic Analysis)
Why — how — did American health insurance become tied to employment? The answer is the same reason that buildings in London display a striking number of bricked over window openings: taxes.
Taxes are practically Pavlovian. Once upon a time, the English government based property taxes on the number of windows a structure had, and thus the people reduced their tax bill by covering up windows. In a similar fashion, U.S. federal government tied health insurance to employment by creating a New Deal tax dodge. Since that has happened, it has rarely occurred to us to mind the marriage, even though it is a source of many of our medical insurance woes.
Among the many crazy laws of the New Deal, such as destroying crops in the midst of a famine as memoralized by “kerosene sprayed over golden mountains” in The Grapes of Wrath, the 1942 Stabilization Act set salary caps. It was an income equality and inflationary measure, which in hindsight seems cruel compared to our modern minimum wage debates.
To entice the best available employees, employers started offering health coverage as additional compensation. Before WWII, healthcare was more catastrophic or palliative, but it didn’t take long for advances in the medical field to turn health insurance into something very desirable.
The off the tax-books compensation quickly became valuable enough that by 1945 the War Labor Board ruled that employers could not modify or cancel group insurance plans during the contract period. Employees had relied upon the offer of healthcare insurance, and so employers were obliged to keep offering it. Health insurance as an employment perk was becoming universal.
Then came the tax break to firmly and formally tie health insurance to employment. The 1954 Internal Revenue Code made employer contributions to employee health plans exempt from the employee’s taxable income and clarified that they were deductible expenses for the employer.
The lack of portability of health insurance? It is a bad habit encouraged by the tax code.
The tie worked well for those decades in which employees stayed with a single company for their entire life and in which insurance companies underestimated their costs. As healthcare has improved and our life spans have lenghtened — positive developments, of course — care costs rapidly changed.
It is easiest to see this in the long-term care market. When long-term care plans for elders became popular, actuaries underestimated not only how many people would live past the time they could care for themselves, but also how many years they might live in that condition. Thus, the early long-term care plans were cheap. Now only a handful of insurance companies offer them because they are so expensive.
Why Long-term Care Insurance Is Becoming a Tougher Call
Mary Julia Klimenko thought she was prudent 20 years ago when she invested in a long-term care insurance policy, one…time.com
The general healthcare insurance market did not miss by quite that much, but rising costs made employers reluctant or unable to continue carrying plans by the turn of the century. The American workforce had already become more mobile and faced the complications of switching insurance whenever they switched jobs, or sourcing their own insurance for those independent contractors of the gig economy.
But the U.S. insurance market was neither set up nor regulated to allow for proper development of an individual insurance market. We still look to fix healthcare through employment-based plans, and many of the tangential debates, such as birth control coverage, are a direct result of our unnecessary habit.
Taxes and habit hold our health insurance and employment together. The portability that Sen. Cruz has suggested is radical only because it has occurred to so few policy makers. But the people and the economy have been clamoring for this reform for some time.
Let’s give portability a chance and stop crafting leglislation based on an employer-provided healthcare model.

Blockchains & Platforms: shaping the future of Insurance and Liabilities
Despite the outlook on risk management — and generally on insurance business — is changing a lot on a global scale, as explained a few days ago by Rob Moffat on Medium and Livio Hughes on the post*shift blog, we are all extremely surprised about how the giants in the insurance industry are sitting in peaceful thinking that their industry is — essentially — protected from any disruption.
As explained effectively by Moffat in his piece, a new actor who decides to enter in the insurance industry has to overcome at least three key barriers:
the regulatory barrier (the insurance industry, such as banking, is heavily regulated)
the one of capital (traditionally insurance companies hold the necessary capital to repay its customers in the event of a claim)
that of the capability to compute risk models by accessing necessary historical data to make risk calculations for the use cases and situations that are normally insured.
However, things could change quickly.
How are business processes and their dependence on risk, changing?
If, on one side, global risk factors that can affect human economies appear to increase (eg: the geopolitical frictions, the risk related to climate instabilities), in an equally fascinating trend, our economy and the business processes that make it up are gradually moving towards lower “operational” risk.
First of all, automation is a powerful trend. Think of autonomous vehicles: these vehicles will be involved in increasingly less accidents, the risk related to insurance coverage on transport, logistics and mobility, will globally decrease, and the insurance burden will gradually shift from the passenger (in the future people will be less likely to own the car they use) to the companies owning fleets, with evident efficiencies. For example, car-sharing operators will pay less in aggregate than car owners would pay , (car possession, today, is somehow made obsolete).
Credits (Ken Conley)
In other sectors (the health sector for example) processes supported by artificial intelligence will help us reducing the impact of human errors, by improving the accuracy of diagnosis and by offering increasingly personalized care these innovations will hopefully decrease health related risks at the global level.
The pervasiveness of information will also make the production processes (increasingly performed by machines) less dependent on unreliable data.
The risk of carrying out unnecessary operations that could potentially create waste or errors (a simple example: a bus that go by a route without passengers waiting) is decreasing.
Think of how, a ubiquitous information, can help us to optimize the logistics of perishable goods — such as food — eliminating risk factors such as food poisoning, and many other accidents. Also it the availability of historical information on people and companies is growing: powerful reputation management systems are born and are consolidating every day more and they help us to take less risks in economic activity and to select the best suppliers and partners.
The Just-in-time production is also an effective way to eliminate waste and logistic risks and — in addition — is characterised by leaner and agile processes that can help us to create the most accurate and relevant products and services for customers, again, intrinsically diminishing the risk related to business activity.
The unbundling of risk and the corporation
In the medium/long term, the Blockchain will be the place where all the relevant information we’ve discussed so far, will be stored as open and public data. Storing publicly and transparently all this risk related information will have a huge impact on risk management models.
When all the information related to business processes is stored online with a reasonably low latency, this makes the risk connected substantially “unbundled”: for example think of being able to access at the geo-referenced location of a truck, its internal temperature (if there is food inside) or even the information about the driver’s state of health.
If until yesterday you had to insure a food distribution by truck from the beginning till the end of the journey (or usually have a framework agreement between the logistics company and the insurer), the insurance provider of tomorrow — that will look more like a high speed risk trader — will be able to secure even a few minutes of the truck route or, maybe, a specific geographical area.
Having the necessary information to calculate risk publicly available almost in real time, will open new ways for the risk negotiation made by autonomous systems (algorithms and bots) and for a huge dose of disruption in the insurance business: a bit like we’ve seen in financial trading with High-frequency trading.
The penetration of the Blockchain, with information available to the public and the strengthening of bots and artificial intelligence adoption will be essential for the birth of a true peer to peer — and less heavily mediated — risk market (as CoinDesk explained few days ago).
In the future foreseen by Olivier Rikken there are three possible roles:
1. that of the user who requires a personalized insurance model (along with other peers),
2. that of the investor who wants to monetize capital
3. that of the insurer who will deal with bringing together these two requirements (a real platform)
“By acting as the provider of the marketplace and the risk intelligence, insurers gain a number of benefits. The capital needed to insure the customers remains at the investors, so the insurer, in turn, can operate with minimal levels of capital or even become completely capital-free.” (from Olivier Rikken on Coindesk)
So risk management is easier, but to identify who is liable is more difficult
However the impact of the Blockchain technology will probably not stop here in the field of insurance and liability. You may have heard of DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization): in the last few weeks the most important DAO project so far — the, slock.it inspired, The Dao — raised the equivalent of more than a hundred million dollars in just few days, attracting interest and concerns.

Essentially a DAO is a complex agreement between equals, who lives in the code.
It looks like an organization, but it is not legally constituted and has no legal status whatsoever.
The software code may be in the familiar form of a client application — that many peers can use to join a “network” — or in the less familiar form of the so-called “smart contract”.
A smart contract is a special software code that — in essence — is managed independently from the interaction of client software that make up the DAO and it’s able to do many interesting things. Today, a smart contract can, for example, transfer funds or property when particular conditions occur. Using intelligent objects such as “smart locks” as the Ethereum computer of Slock.it — essentially actuators connected to the network — the DAO would be able not only to open doors and windows but also to command a self driving car or drone and much more. At one point the features of a DAO may include the ability to buy products, hire contractors and extend the impact well beyond the realm of software or smart objects.
DAOs: exciting as a headless Godzilla walking on your home
Godzilla (from 1954)
Sounds exciting huh? It’s exciting just like a headless Godzilla inexorably walking on your home. Challenging.
In fact DAOs are essentially legal forms that are not yet recognized.
Trying to sue them in court or to make them responsible for any problems could be a daunting task. If nobody possesses it, we might be tempted to think that no one is essentially responsible and that everyone interacts with the DAO at its own risk, a risk that he should be able to calculate. A bit as we did in the early days of Bitcoin, you may be tempted to say: “use it at your own risk.”
But are we — as a society — likely to have to deal with this risk framework and with this passivity to potentially so powerful entities? I don’t buy it.
As some have already pointed out (read “How to Sue a DAO” which well explains the Anglo-Saxon context) when it comes to assess who is responsible, the law — according to the different codes of law that we have in the different countries — will be able to find a way to identify the person responsible and, in some cases, this person will have the traits of the scapegoat, or of the one who, perhaps unconsciously, may end up being who bears most of the responsibility.
So, if on one hand the DAO, the smart contracts and public data on Blockchain, represent a powerful new set of tools that can eliminate bureaucracies and make disruption of the incumbent, on the other hand these instruments are in direct conflict with the concept of responsibility in top of which we have built the history of the trade and of our business.
I think that this discontinuity will lead us to see a great transformation of the market for those who are in the insurance and liability sectors and in general for all the brands.
The future of the insurance will therefore be on one side unbundled and commoditized — with trading of standardized risk and high-speed on Blockchain — and on the other will be a key process to give the brand a chance to take responsibility for complex and dynamic business processes that they will create by combining components as the DAO, smart contracts, distributed resources and open-source data: that “general intellect” that — despite the destructive force — can not be held legally responsible.
In a nutshell, Platforms (not only in the insurance industry) will increasingly take advantage of distributed tools and resources to build their business processes. These processes will be made of activities and information that are not owned by the brand itself, but of which the brand will be accountable for towards the user and the law; in doing so, the ability to calculate the overall risk of such complex combinations, will be an essential factor in determining the success of tomorrow’s brands and companies.

Which is the greatest frustration of the insurance companies responsible for providing us care. Thanks for the immensely better coverage via Medicaid, Obama, I’ll miss you.

Paul Ryan won’t say how many people will lose insurance under Trumpcare
“It’s up to people.”
CREDIT: AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite
On Sunday, Trumpcare architect-in-chief Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said he didn’t know how many people would lose their insurance under his Obamacare replacement plan.
In a revealing exchange with CBS News, he suggested that it was “up to people” how far the uninsured rate would climb.
“Here’s the premise of your question: Are you going to stop mandating people buy health insurance?” he said. “People are going to do what they want to do with their lives, because we believe in individual freedom in this country. So the question is, are we providing a system where people have access to health care insurance if they choose to do so?”

In a sense, Ryan is correct that it would be “up to people” how much health coverage would shrink. Trumpcare provides more “freedom” than Obamacare by scrapping the individual mandate — the provision of the Affordable Care Act which penalizes individuals who choose to go without health insurance — and replacing it with a new system that punishes anyone who tries to leave the insurance pool and then come back later on.
The individual mandate exists to prevent what health policy experts call a “death spiral,” where insurance premiums climb asymptotically as the cost of insuring people becomes more and more expensive. Here’s how it works: Without the mandate, healthier people have less incentive to buy insurance, so it’s likelier that more of them would drop out of the insurance market. But that makes the risk pool riskier, since it would now be disproportionately comprised of people who are sicker, and therefore costlier to insure. That would force insurance companies to raise their premiums, which in turn would push more individuals to drop their insurance, leaving behind an even higher-risk pool and causing premiums to shoot up even more. And so on.
Paul Ryan admitted he has no idea how health insurance works
Ladies and gentlemen, meet the conservative movement’s Great Wonk.thinkprogress.org
In his CBS interview, Ryan suggested that the insured rate would drop because, without the mandate, people would be more free to choose life without health insurance. But those who make that choice will disproportionately be the young and healthy, and by leaving the insurance market they would end up driving premiums sky high for those who remain. It’s likely that health insurance would then become far too expensive even for many of those who do want it.
That’s a strange kind of liberty: A world where everyone has, in theory, the abstract freedom to buy health insurance, but only a select few can actually afford it.
For those who love that particular kind of freedom, the Trumpcare bill includes even more good news: Because it reduces subsidies for low-income people to buy insurance, health care would start getting more expensive under the law even before the death spiral kicked in.

Insurance finally jumps on the FinTech bandwagon
This week is London Technology Week and Innovate Finance has launched its own series of complimentary events, focusing on FinTech. Our second event, Insuring the Future of FinTech, brought together incumbents and startups to discuss the trends and opportunities in the space — connected devices to digitalisation, the potential is huge.
#IFWEEK Insuring the Future Through FinTech, Tuesday 16th June 2015
The arrival of the FinTech unicorns, or billion dollar-valued companies, has been widely publicised. There are 36 of these FinTech unicorns globally, however, only three of those companies fall into the insurance space. Whilst peer-to-peer lenders and money transfer startups threaten incumbent banks, large insurers have remained largely unchallenged. Thunprecedented turnout at our insurance event, suggests that things are about to change. In fact, 2015 is already the biggest year on record in terms of investment in the insurance technology space, with $831 million invested so far in the US across 20 deals.
So what has sparked this change? And will it actually make a difference?
Innovation in the insurance space will be and has largely been driven by the availability of data-driven insights. Not only are insurers becoming better at interpreting data, but the availability of data is rapidly increasing, for example, due to the Internet of Things (IoT). The lines between our digital and physical worlds are being progressively blurred. Smart devices, from wearables, to home sensors and vehicle telematics, are expanding our insight into and control over the physical world, promising to transform the insurance industry forever. The data which these connected devices gather is allowing insurers to refine risk and redefine their products, revolutionising customer relations. Rather than receiving a premium based on aggregate demographic considerations, data-driven insights can, for the first time, allow insurers to offer their customers bespoke products.
As noted by our participants, this is already taking place in the auto insurance space, with new models based on vehicle telematics. FinTech startups such as InsureTheBox and Drive Like A Girl, as well as established players such as Aviva already use metrics such as how customers drive or how often they hit the brakes, to personalise premiums.
Similar models are beginning to be applied in the health insurance sector. John Egan, Director at Anthemis, noted that above 50% startups in the insurance space are now focusing on wearables and health. One could foresee a future in which wearable devices will allow insurers to reward individuals who exercise regularly and eat healthily via lower premiums. Likewise, John imagines a consumer ordering a plate of fries and a beer at a restaurant and subsequently being penalised with a higher premium.
With everything connected, what could go wrong?
Although the IoT and the subsequent customisation of insurance products should be perceived as a positive step forward, Wern Ding from Swiss Re rightly pointed out that these developments will undoubtedly give rise to privacy concerns, “there will always be a question mark in terms of the value an individual places on his or her privacy.” Consumers will have to balance premium discounts with the fact that the company owns their data and profile. The key for insurers, in this case, will be to notify individuals about how their activities are being assessed, give them the choice of ‘opting in’ and explicitly share with them the choices of actionable information at the decision-stage.
Another barrier to the adoption of IoT in insurance is the cybersecurity issue of sharing multiple devices and networks. It has been said that 70% of the most commonly used IoT devices contain vulnerabilities, as devices and networks can be hacked. This represents a huge barrier for insurers who will sooner or later depend on the data extracted from those networks and devices to provide a more personalised service.
But the biggest risk of all might be if insurers miss the opportunity on IoT altogether and merely use data from connected devices to tweak their product offering. With devices connected to businesses, homes and cars, organisations are going to begin to offer solutions that have the IoT connected and services tied to that. This opens up an opportunity for those organisations, perhaps digital giants such as Google or Amazon, to manage the customer relationship, customer loyalty and the customer experience, with insurance just being a small part of that offering. For instance, one can foresee a future where connected thermostats monitor the humidity levels of homes so as to detect potential mould and will be sold with specific housing insurance tied into them. So for insurers to stay relevant, it is vital that they consider these new business opportunities.
A final note on digitalisation
Clearly, IoT is a vital part of the conversations on the future of insurance, digitalisation will play an equally important role in this moving forward. James York, founder of Worry + Peace, pointed to the fact that individuals have become accustomed to seamless user experiences and have come to base their expectations for insurance on their interactions with services such as Uber or Spotify. Customers want to be able to use a channel most convenient at that moment, whether that’s a website, mobile app, call centre or video chat with a broker. Similarly, insurers could be taking social media more seriously, recognising its value as a relatively inexpensive marketing tool and a means to engage with and influence skeptical, digitally-savvy younger consumers. Addressing this digital challenge is a matter of survival, as those insurance companies that act too late, or stumble through the transition will undoubtedly lose consumers and market share.
Whilst many incumbents have identified digital and IoT opportunities, a host of new startups, some of which were present at our insurance event, are beginning to break into the space. Gaggel, for instance, aims to make insurance fairer and more transparent and has introduced an element of risk sharing amongst a consumer’s chosen peer group. Likewise, Worry + Peace markets itself as the new personal insurance destination for the modern digital shopper and has recently launched an own-brand Gadget Insurance product. Bought By Many offers another interesting solution by inviting groups of people with specific insurance needs to club together and then negotiates better policies on their behalf.
Whether one of these FinTech startups will be the next unicorn, has yet to be seen. However, given the discussion which took place at our #Insurance Knowledge Hack, there is no doubt that the next few years will see the rise of more billion dollar insurance startups.
Got an idea of who could be the next insurance unicorn? Think you know which innovations and trends will drive the insurance industry forward? Let us know in comments or tweet @InnFin using the #IFWEEK hashtag.

You do realize that there are countries that manage to provide single payer health insurance, right? Apparently your massive research failed to delve into how they manage to accomplish that.


My Health Insurance Just Shut Down Operations. I’m Scared.
Do 200,000 New Yorkers deserve “Shut Down Subsidies” as recourse after losing their Health Republic insurance network?
In November of 2013 I wrote about my experience navigating the New York State Marketplace. The process was too complicated but I was so excited when I finally settled on a plan. I believed I had done my research and asked the right questions. And I had. But it hasn’t been easy.
18 months later I wrote a followup post describing how difficult my health insurance experience had been. I called that post One Year Later: Health Republic Affordable Care Act Health Insurance Has Failed Me. And it had.
Since that post, I had found an amazing ally at Health Republic. This wonderful woman and I emailed at least weekly. And through our communications, my experience with Health Republic improved immeasurably. Most importantly, my doctors were finally getting paid. They even got paid on time.
And then I got this email. Suddenly it feels as though my whole world has shattered. It quite literally took my breath away.
Good Morning Liz,
I hope this message finds you well.
I am writing to provide some very unfortunate news… On Friday Health Republic was told to shut down operations by the end of the year. This is a surprise to the staff as well as the members as we (internally) were preparing for open enrollment and continued growth and improvement for the upcoming year. I am writing to you, now, to ensure I am able to say “farewell”…It has been a pleasure providing assistance to you. Although Health Republic may no longer be after this year, I hope that you’ll never forget us and what we strived for, even through the frustrations of the unique operational model you encountered. Although I may be unable to assist, directly (after a presently unknown date), or provide guidance, I would like to extend my contact details. If you ever need an ear, a shoulder, an opinion… you can feel free to reach out to me. My email address is below.
Best regards,
It took two years to get my Health Insurance plan to work for me. And when it started to work, it became a support system. I recently needed to see a Neuro Ophthalmologist. The reasons why were scary. And when I mentioned to my Health Republic ally how long it would take to get in, they called the doc and got me an appointment the very next day. When I arrived for the appointment, I found an email in my inbox from my HR ally asking if I had arrived, asking if I needed any help. And when I left, I got an email from my HR ally wishing me well. She felt relief when I told her it was all going to be ok.
Now it’s gone. And I don’t know what to do. Do I just start over, I don’t want another two year fight to get the coverage I need. Do I find out where my Health Republic ally is going and follow her? She cared. I want someone to care. Or do I give up on my doctors, the doctors who have not only brought me back to life, but given me a life in which I can thrive. I know I won’t choose the latter. But I’m lost. I wish the plan I had worked so hard for carried over. Because without it, I’m lost. Scared. And heartbroken.
All I can say is I’m bearing the grunt of some incredible nation-wide growing pains. I can only hope that my continued fight will have a positive affect on a system that will eventually work. Because it will eventually work. It has to. It can’t stay like this. I deserve better. I deserve everything my Health Republic ally gave me. And so do you.
… and no, it’s not Obama’s fault.
Update: Please take a moment to consider that I am just one of 200,000 New Yorkers who have found themselves in this situation. I believe there needs to be some recourse. And consider how gracious the email was that my my now jobless ally sent me. Heartbreak abounds.
Update: I have reached out to New York State of Health asking for recourse (a shut down subsidy?). I will let you know when they respond. This is what I said:
Hi NY State of Health. I just received notice that my health insurance is shutting down at the end of this year. I believe I (as well as other Health Republic insurees) are deserving of a little recourse. I have a letter from Health Republic stating my Out of Network doctor is covered as in network in perpetuity, and I would like your assistance in assuring this coverage is carried over to my next Marketplace plan. Can you please help me get back in touch with the right person to make this happen? Thanks so much.


One Year Later: Health Republic Affordable Care Act Health Insurance Has Failed Me.
My name is Liz Jackson. I’m a 33 year old New Yorker. I have a chronic neuromuscular condition. And I have doctors. Lots of doctors. Who need to be paid. I am writing this post because I don’t know what to do to ensure my doctors will get paid. The issue is my health insurance. I selected Health Republic from the New York State marketplace. And they haven’t been living up to their end of the bargain. This post is a plea for help. Do you have resources? Do you have advice? Are you the Attorney General? My doctors have sacrificed so much for me. They need to be paid. And they deserve to know why they haven’t been.
Other things you may want to know. I’m smart. I’m resilient. I am well educated. I am persistent. Seriously, I am PERSISTENT. I’m a vocal supporter of the Affordable Care Act. And a year ago, I wrote an enthusiastic and optimistic post titled 15 Days On The Obamacare Marketplace. Since then, I have failed to successfully navigate the Health Republic NY Silver plan I selected.
So if I, an intelligent 33 year old, college educated, persistent adult with time and access cannot navigate my Affordable Care Act health insurance… who can?
This is a list of email correspondences I have had with Health Republic NY. There are over 100 emails. This doesn’t take into account the calls I have made to both Health Republic, NY State of Health, Community Health Advocates and The Attorney General’s Office.
3/7/14 Spoke with Representative prior to signing up about long term continuation of coverage with an out of network doctor. She provided me with an Access to Care and Transitional Out of Network Referral Form.
4/23/14 I submitted the Access to Care form prior to start date. I cited recommendations by Kathleen Sebelius about continuation of coverage. I inquired about the process to submit and review.
4/24/14 I am notified that my Health Insurance had an effective start date of 4/1/14, even though I was covered by employee health insurance until the end of April. This requires 6 phone calls to Health Republic and NY State of Health before the situation is resolved. It took hours.
5/1/14 I’m now covered under a Health Republic NY Silver Plan
9/2014 Health Republic has not paid for May for my Out of Network doctor (who will now be referred to as OND), even though I was informed the doctor would be covered as in network per my request on 4/23/14.
9/26/14 I was told claims were paid.
10/10/14 My OND still has not received payment.
10/20/14: My OND receives payment from Health Republic in the form of a Credit Card. Seriously.
11/6/14 I can’t find an in network dermatologist, I call every dermatologist within 30 minutes, and each of them have dropped Health Republic, citing discomfort with coverage. I have to go past New York State’s 30 Minute 30 Mile law to see a doctor for a rosacea flare up. I asked Health Republic to update their dermatologists and they weren’t willing to do this.
I tell this to Health Republic:
“There is the exception of [redacted] Dermatology P.C. but their reviews online consist of rudeness, pain, aggressiveness, and a mean staff.”
11/5/14 I was notified that my approval for my OND was only for 90 days. I specifically had asked prior to joining Health Republic for no end date on continuation of coverage, citing a chronic illness. Health Republic said they made OND aware of this 90 day condition. OND was not made aware. I send Health Republic a copy of what OND received.
12/15/14 Health Republic says in writing they will give me until Feb of 2015 and then stop OND’s coverage. But an hour prior I had recorded a call where I was told they were going to give me limitless coverage. They acquiesce. OND is now covered. I receive a letter in writing.
12/18/14 There’s a billing Issue. I just logged onto Health Republic to pay my bill and it went from $114 to $2127. Takes months to resolve billing issue.
1/22/15 I inquire as to why OND hasn’t been paid since we received letter of ongoing coverage.
1/25/15 Was told claims were in process.
2/5/15 OND still hasn’t received payment for October November December or January
2/6/15 I’m told claims were incorrectly declined, resubmit.
2/23/15 OND still hasn’t received payment
3/2/15 Claims denied again in error — for October 2014 moving forward
3/15/15 Billing issue with Primary Care (In Network) I keep getting charged $15 when I think copay should be $0 My card has two Co-Pay’s listed:
Primary Physician Co-Pay — $0
Primary Care Co-Pay — $15
I had assumed that since my doctor was my primary care physician, there would be no co-pay. I was wrong. I now owe $15 for every primary care visit since 5/1/2014
3/16/15 OND receives request for doctors notes. OND believes the request is illegal. Still hasn’t been paid. Health Republic tells me the request for doctors notes was an error. OND won’t see me again until she’s paid. I tweet to every member of Health Republic’s board.
3/18/15 OND gets paid for October November December and January
4/14/15 I inquire about February as OND hasn’t been paid. I am told my contact at Health Republic (who I was comfortable communicating with) was no longer in the dept and will no longer help me.
4/22/15 New Health Republic rep writes to say claims for February are still in process. I respond with a series of questions, explaining how the last time my OND’s claims were in process they were incorrectly denied. I also ask a series of questions, most notably the fairness of advertising a benefit like acupuncture on the marketplace when Health Republic pays only 9% ($8) of the bill.

5/6/15 I write old rep saying new rep hasn’t answered any of my questions.
5/11/15 I write every Health Republic email I have. This is what I say:
“I wrote 27 days ago with a series of questions and still have no response. [New Rep], if you are not able to assist me in the manner that [Old Rep] was able, will you please forward my information to someone who can?
This is 3 months after the last fiasco and I was promised this would not happen again. My doctor has not been paid since January and she is growing impatient. I was happy working with [Old Rep], I need a solution that prevents this from continuing to happen.”
5/11/15 Again I’m told claims for Feb and March are still in process. I ask for clarification.
5/13/15 I receive claim numbers for finalized claims. No details on when checks will be sent. I also learn that my Out of Pocket is not $1,000 as I thought but $4,500. And my deductible is not $0 as I thought but $2,000. I scour my records for proof, realize none was ever sent by NY State of Health or Health Republic. There’s no record of what I signed up for. How can I be expected to trust Health Republic’s word?
5/19/15 NY State of Health informs me they’re not able to access the information for what I signed up for. I contact the Attorney Generals Office. Health Republic offers to make a call to NY State of Health with me. I decide to hold off and wait for AG’s office.
5/20/15 Speak with an advocate at the AG’s office
5/21/15 discover my monthly Health Republic payment has gone up (again) from $119.16 a month to $2,080.16. I also receive a letter saying I’m maxed out on benefits for Acupuncture (this is an in-network Acupuncturist, and Health Republic rejected every claim she submitted). I start this list. I will be updating.
Currently, I have not had anyone speak with me about
- Whether OND’s check has been mailed
- Why my benefits are so low on acupuncture (when it is advertised on the marketplace as a benefit)
- Why I’m maxed out on benefits on acupuncture
- How I can get my OND paid on time
- How to get my payment back down to $119.16
- What could have possibly happened to cause such a disconnect between what I thought my out of network/deductible were and what Health Republic tells me they are. Why is there no proof.
- And who my dedicated health republic representative will be.
I have written emails begging (BEGGING) for help, for an advocate, for someone to dedicate a few hours of their time. I have begged dozens of times. There’s no asking I can do to get their attention. I have spoken with various representatives within Health Republic (including the Corporate level) and nothing works.
My OND is someone who previously would have considered carrying an Affordable Care Act insurance. But I can’t imagine she would ever consider it now, not after the blind eye Health Republic has turned to her. I will reiterate, she still hasn’t been paid for February, March or April. It suddenly seems so obvious why there are no in network dermatologists within 30 minutes of my NYC home.
So again I must ask. If I, a college educated, persistent, adult who is aware of my rights cannot navigate Health Republic’s marketplace insurance… who (WHO!) can?
One Final Note: I am also a trained healthcare advocate.

All Millennials Should Understand These 4 Simple Truths about Insurance
Do you really understand what your policy covers?
Everyone should know what their home or auto policy covers. Sign up for a free policy review with one of Covered’s insurance experts.
Want to stop a conversation dead it its tracks? Ask your friends about their home or auto insurance. You’ll be greeted with blank stares and awkward silence, and will likely receive fewer invites to social gatherings in the future.
As confusing (and boring) as insurance is, it’s vital to know the basics and understand what your home or auto policy covers — otherwise, you might be setting yourself up for a world of hurt when something unexpected happens.

To help you wrap your head around the complexities of insurance, here are 4 simple truths that anyone with a home or auto policy should understand.
Insurance isn’t a warranty
You buy homeowner’s insurance to protect yourself against specific losses, such a fire, theft, weather damage, and other unexpected events. Unlike the warranty you buy for an expensive TV or a fancy refrigerator, insurance doesn’t cover normal wear and tear such as leaks, cracks, or routine maintenance.
If your water heater suddenly stops working, your insurance will not pay for a replacement. However, if your water heater is damaged by a specific event that you have coverage for (say, a burglary), your insurance company will pay for repairs or a replacement.
Insurance is not a maintenance plan or warranty. Keeping your home or vehicle in working order will always be up to you.
Your stuff is worth less than you think
Read your insurance policy carefully and make sure you understand if you have actual cash value coverage or replacement cost coverage.
Replacement cost coverage is much better, but you pay a price for it. This type of coverage pays the amount it will cost to replace damaged property (due to a covered cause of loss) with new comparable goods, despite the age or condition of the damaged property.
Let’s say you paid $500 for a state-of-the-art tube TV with a built-in DVD player. 10 years later, your TV is destroyed in a fire. If you have replacement cost coverage, your insurer will pay for the cost to buy the same TV today, new. You’ll get whatever amount it would cost to go out and buy the exact same TV today (good luck finding one that’s still for sale though).
If you have actual cash value coverage, your insurer will decide how much the tv was worth after factoring in 10 years of depreciation. They’ll likely reimburse you for way less than you originally paid since a tube TV with 10 years of use isn’t worth very much.
“Full coverage” isn’t really a thing.
When you’re shopping for home or auto insurance, you will never find a policy or package that is called “full coverage.” It simply doesn’t exist. While there are different levels of coverage you can buy when shopping for home or auto insurance, no single policy will provide protection against every possible scenario.
Coverage gaps are serious, and it’s important to at least consider purchasing an umbrella for additional coverage.
If you think you’re buying full coverage, you’re not. There are ALWAYS exclusions in an insurance policy. Read your policy carefully and make sure you understand what’s excluded.
Filing a bunch of claims can jack up your rates
If you file an excessive amount of claims, your insurance company can — and likely, will — raise your rates. They can even deem you too “risky,” and decline to renew your policy once you reach the end of your term.
I know what you’re thinking: “How can an insurance company penalize me for using a service I paid for?”
When it comes to increased premium due to filing insurance claims, it’s not just the severity of the claim that drives rates, but also the frequency of filing claims. This is why it makes sense to avoid filing claims for minor auto or home issues.
If you want to be financially responsible and prepared for unexpected losses, you need to know how your insurance works and what it covers. No one ever wants to find themselves saying, “but I thought that was covered!” after their roof caves in.

Children’s Health Insurance Program: A Health Care Lifeline That Benefits Us All
We talk about a lot of issues in the U.S. Senate — taxes, education, ways to smartly balance the use of our natural resources and how to help everybody achieve the American Dream, to name just a few.
Each one is important and each is worthy of our attention.
But if you’re not healthy — and especially if your children aren’t healthy and they don’t have access to comprehensive, affordable health care — those matters fade in importance. The quality of health care and our ability to use it touches all of us. And that’s why we want to spend a few minutes highlighting the importance of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and why we and other Democrats in the Senate are locking arms tightly to make sure CHIP is here to stay.
Simply put, CHIP is a success and millions of kids are healthier because of it. CHIP is a federal-state partnership created in 1997 that provides comprehensive and affordable care to 10 million kids who in most cases are in families that earn too much income to qualify for Medicaid but too little to be able to afford private health insurance.
Every state has taken advantage of CHIP and that’s one reason the uninsured rate for children has dropped dramatically since CHIP’s enactment — from 14 percent in 1997 to a record low of 7 percent in 2012.
The program has always enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress and last year, nearly 40 governors responded to a joint request by the Senate Finance Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee for ground-level feedback about CHIP. Support for the program was universal with Democratic and Republican governors alike praising the services CHIP provides and how it is run and managed.
But here’s the catch: Funding for CHIP runs out on Sept. 30 unless Congress acts. We can’t let that happen. That’s the reason we introduced legislation on Feb. 12 that would guarantee funding for CHIP through 2019. We’ve named the bill the “Protecting & Retaining Our Children’s Health Insurance Program (PRO-CHIP) Act of 2015.”
It’s a good bill for a great program and there isn’t time to waste. Governors have told us in no uncertain terms that they need Congress to act now because now is when most states are finalizing their budgets for the year. Congress needs to act within the next few months so both states and millions of people who depend on CHIP have certainty.
The bill we’ve introduced is a path of least resistance and one that senators from both parties can support. It essentially extends the current program — as is — through 2019. This is the same program that nine Republican senators and 40 Republican House members supported in 2009, the last time CHIP was considered by Congress. More recently, governors as diverse as Gary Herbert, a Republican from Utah and Deval Patrick, a Democrat from Massachusetts wrote to Congress last year expressing support for CHIP and urging Congress to extend it as soon as possible. And last month, former Sen. Bill Frist — a Republican, former Senate Majority Leader and a physician — tweeted this: “I fought for Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in 1997, and Congress must extend CHIP this year.”
He’s right.
The stakes are high. With CHIP’s strong performance over the years and its bipartisan history there is no reason for delay and for doing what’s necessary to ensure that 10 million kids continue receiving the comprehensive, affordable care they need.
Wyden is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. Senators Brown, Stabenow and Casey are members of the Senate Finance Committee.

The Internet of Things and the End of the Auto Insurance Industry as You Know It

When Tesla and others comes out with broad production of driverless cars, the question of who’s going to insure them is not reassuring to the insurance companies. Nor are a host of other threats from new technology. Insurance firms are already getting bombarded with a digital disruption from two different directions: the Internet of Things and Big Data.
With $600B at stake in the global auto insurance business, the industry is going to be upended. When billions of Things (connected sensors) can communicate what they measure with other Things in the cloud in a constant barrage of both structured and unstructured data, the results will get funneled down into customized consumer choices that do one big thing auto insurers don’t typically do today: save you money!
At first blush, it would appear that insurers with their historical access to data and the creation of actuarial algorithms would be a natural to adapt to IoT, however, insurers have just been a bit behind. Their interaction with their customers is so infrequent that they have to wait for second order data — e.g., reported auto accidents or speeding tickets processed through the DMV, to have any visibility into client behavior and risk.
“Inertia is not loyalty. With the amount of money we each spend on insurance, it’s almost unfathomable to imagine how owning our own big data is going to change the shopping equation.” — Marty Ellingsworth, insurance expert.
An insurance company spends the most money on one category: paying for claims (65% of every premium dollar). If they’re lucky, when they subtract agent commissions, , underwriting expenses, advertising and all overhead, they are left with a 5–10% profit.
The grand strategy of insurance companies will be transformed by IoT and big data. Direct measurement of driving behavior, which can transform the way insurers make underwriting and pricing decisions, enables more rapid response after accidents, and provides forensic data for claims investigation.
IoT offers the opportunity for growth and yet also a threat to existence. The impact of this change is intuitive on its face but difficult to fathom in its fullest, most radical potential.
There are four ostensible ways to help lower your auto premium. 1) Don’t be a teenage boy — they pay through the nose because of their statistical probability of having an accident. 2) Have five years of no accidents or tickets so you are classified as a “safe driver” 3) Have a good credit score (yes, believe it or not, it matters) and 4) Get a telematics tracking device linked back to your insurer installed in your car and show that you are a safe driver, especially if you’re a teen willing to drive safely.
Telematics, which is the use of wireless devices to transmit data in real time back to an organization has been tried in the auto insurance industry for some time and is the front edge of IoT. It’s used in the context of automobiles, whereby installed or after-factory boxes collect and transmit data on vehicle use, maintenance requirements or automotive servicing.

Usage-based insurance (UBI) is a very big incentive to adopt some aspect of telematics. Insurers already use mileage as a pricing variable, but they just haven’t had a reliable way to collect actual mileage. They typically offer lower pricing for lower mileage, with 12k miles being one common threshold. The threat that any financial player armed with the technology to qualify a driver as safe has scared the insurance industry. New tech entrants like Metromile can measure a driver’s actual mileage and provide insurance based on a per-thousand mileage scale. However, safe driving habits have an even bigger role in driving UBI, or “pay as you drive” as it’s often called in Europe.
How can telematics lower your insurance premiums?
John Sundean, an insurance industry expert and former Accenture Partner says “early insurance telematics adopters have found that, in addition to total miles driven, frequent harsh braking is a powerful predictor of accidents. If an insurer can measure that then they have a keen idea of whether you’re a safe driver or not. Harsh braking is followed closely by rapid acceleration, aggressive cornering and late night driving. Telematics can measure all those factors.”
If you’re willing to go beyond privacy concerns and give insurers the right to monitor your driving performance, you have a chance to get a lower premium and save hundreds every year.
In Italy, installed telematics devices have been around for over a decade as a premier option because of the high rate of auto theft and fraud. Tracking the stolen car is one key benefit of lowering an already high premium. Insurers in the UK have always had high rates for teen drivers and have offered a lowered premium for those drivers willing to have the black boxes (about the size of a cellphone) installed in their cars. In return for a telematics record that shows safe driving, they can have their rates lowered from the $3K+ normal rate for teenage boys.
Progressive Insurance has recognized the threat of IoT and importance of telematics for over a decade and has been on the front end of the U.S. effort. After all, Progressive now bills over $2B in telematics premium in a U.S. industry who only has a 2 percent penetration. Progressive has collected over 10 billion miles of driving data with Snapshot, its Pay As You Drive program, since introducing its first wireless device in January 2008. Progressive leads the usage-based insurance (UBI) industry with two million vehicles that have participated in the program.
The company has recently entered into a partnership with GM’s OnStar that will allow owners of all 2016 GM models, most 2015 models and some 2013 and 2014 models to have their driving ability rated and get a Progressive UBI policy.
“OnStar will introduce a safe driving assessment service for its customers,” says David Pratt, Progressive’s UBI general manager. “After three months, they will send the drivers an e-mail telling them how they did and what they can do to improve. And they will send a suggestion on the insurance option.”
Progressive is betting that drivers who see how well they stack up to others will want to turn that into saving money with it. “One advantage for the customer is that he or she never has to install a device,” Pratt says. This is not only a benefit for the customer, but for the product as well. “Any technology that makes it easier for customers to participate will help UBI become mainstream,” he says.
Verizon Telematics is working with a number of insurers to track both individuals’ cars and corporate fleets. As insurance companies move into “telematics” in homes and on individuals, expect to see more partnerships being forged. State Farm and ADT, the home security company, have an alliance to apply IoT to monitor your home and vehicles in one unified offering.
There are even apps that provide similar telematics information. After all, most of the driving behavior insurers need can be measured by the accelerometer and GPS already embedded in your smartphone.
My experience using the free driving app I downloaded has been fascinating. Drivewise (from Driveway) sends me a text assessing my performance within a minute of finishing a drive. I might be rated as an “elegantly moving top gun” (score 100), “brake riding road roaster”(score 65) or cast aspersions on my ability to even safely navigate the commute home. I like the top gun status more of course, but if the app was connected to my insurance company, I’d also pay much more attention to its feedback.
As fun and impressive Driveway is, so far it only knows you’re moving. Not how. You could be a passenger in someone else’s car. Last weekend, I got a stellar rating on my driving when actually I had just finished a warm Sunday ride through the Santa Cruz Mountains on my bicycle.
The vast universe of connected Things producing Big Data allows other new entrants in the market threaten the insurance industry from offline distribution through brick-and-mortar agents and call centers to online, direct-to-consumer sales. CoverHound is a marketplace for car insurance: an easy-to-use online comparison-shopping tool and a purchasing experience on the site itself, rather than through an insurer’s clunky interface of fax and phone — or worse, the storefront agent’s office.
Insurers will need to build ‘ecosystems’ (networks of companies, individuals and institutions that interact and provide services) in order to promote, supply, install and service connected devices. Insurers also need to be mindful that there are a finite number of relevant potential partners for the new ecosystems that will shape the future of their industry. Read: Get in now or miss the boat.
From a strategic perspective, the key questions for insurers are ‘who will have the data I need in 10 years’ time?’ and ‘who will have the primary -, and more valuable — customer relationships?’
Sensors in cars will provide data about the location and usage patterns of the vehicle and therefore a more accurate fix on the risks of theft and accidents. We will be barraged with data on restaurants, stores, gas stations within our car’s vicinity with low prices, great reviews, special discounts and more galore. Data analytics have to be able to assess risk behaviors and individual profiles as telematics exabytes spill forth.
Mobility will allow driving consumers to take advantage of these offers as they roll down the road from commute to errands to schools to home with the ease of using stored payment info in a concierge offering that might be called Super-Uber…or Uber-Uber or, maybe, just plain Uber, which was capitalized last year at a value of $17B.
“Put it on my tab” will be the mantra of the connected consumer and, in particular, the connected driver.
Dealing in a transparent market in buying behaviors will disrupt many large incumbent insurers who will not go away easily. They will acquire the right players, develop their own technology and do what they can to be a survivor.
As a consumer of all things, you will be able to “opt-in” (and, yes, be very cautious about privacy intrusion) to have your data in the cloud where it’s married with data analytics and , voila, have a vast, convenient and competitively-priced marketplace of a bevy of consumer offerings. It won’t be more than a few months before drivers will perhaps be thumbing their noses at the traditional auto insurers who’ve perhaps overcharged several thousand dollars.
Imagine this! You upload your driving data onto the Internet and say, “Here’s my make, model, mileage, credit score and driving record. Bid on me!”
If any financial player is willing to be regulated like the insurance companies so that consumers are protected, then the field of entrants is wide open. The data will flow to those agile enough to turn it into savings. Who’s to say you hear back on a rate quote from State Farm or Geico or Progressive? The lowest rate might come back to you from some financial entity seemingly as far afield today as…a hedge fund?
The road is wide open. Fasten your seat belts!

Trump to Replace Health Insurance with Health Protection

The president-elect today outlined an ambitious plan to replace the Affordable Care Act with expanded access to health protection.
“Obamacare = millions of Americans w/health insurance. Sad,” Mr. Trump tweeted at 3:42 a.m. “My plan = pay $ and my sons won’t inject you w Zika.”
Mr. Trump’s plan is modeled on the infamous mob protection rackets, where mobsters would extort businesses for money in exchange for “protection” from violence, theft, and arson usually committed by the organized crime syndicate itself when owners refused to pay.
Under Mr. Trump’s plan, Americans will pay a fee in exchange for protection from diseases the Trump Organization will release on citizens who opt out of the program, via biological warfare.
“My plan = much more affordable,” the incoming president Tweeted at 4:13 a.m. “Only $10/week, collected by Eric on Wednesdays.”


As More People Sign Up for Health Insurance, America’s Health-Care Costs Go Up
Prescription drug costs also grew.
By Francie Diep
(Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images)
Health-care spending in the United States totaled $3.2 trillion last year, or nearly $10,000 per person, according to newly released government figures. That’s an uptick of almost 6 percent — sizable compared to the Great Recession years, but still lower than or on par with cost increases in the early 2000s.
Researchers attribute the rise, which occurred in 2014 as well, to the fact that the Affordable Care Act was finally fully implemented across the country, and with it came more people with health insurance and, consequently, more trips to the hospital and doctor’s office. Fifteen million Americans gained health insurance between 2013 and 2015.
Is Obamacare Working?
We weigh the evidence.

“In 2014 and 2015, we have the one-time effects of the ACA expansion,” Aaron Catlin, deputy director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ National Health Statistics Group, said during a call for reporters.
Yet previous research from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had suggested this won’t be a one-time thing. Based on existing health-care laws — which the upcoming Trump administration has promised to change — researchers predicted health spending would grow over the next decade by an average of about 6 percent per year and would eventually make up a little more than one-fifth of America’s economy. In 2015, health-care spending accounted for 17.8 percent of America’s gross domestic product. In 1980, it was 9 percent.
In 2015, health-care spending accounted for 17.8 percent of America’s gross domestic product.
So who is spending so much more for health care than they had before? One hard-hit payer was the federal government, which spent nearly 10 percent more on Medicaid—totaling $545 billion—than in years past. Private health insurance companies saw their costs go up too, as a result of more people having access to benefits. In addition, some research suggests those newly insured after the passage of the ACA tended to be sicker and thus costlier for insurance companies than the average insured American prior to Obamacare.
We Can Finally Cure Hepatitis C, but It’s Costing Taxpayers a Fortune
A 12-week course of treatment with the most popular drug has a list price of about $95,000, or $1,100 a day.psmag.com
Prescription drug costs also grew significantly, by 9 percent, during 2015. There were new, pricey medicines released last year, including a $1,100-a-day hepatitis C drug that vastly improved patients’ quality of life. The year 2015 also saw some companies hike the prices of their existing brand-name drugs, and was notable for its lack of patent expirations on blockbuster drugs—something that brought health-care costs down in the early 2010s with brand names like Lipitor and Plavix.
The debate that will now follow is whether this spending growth would have been even higher without Obamacare.






More (Bad) News About My 2017 Health Insurance
This story keeps getting better. I mean, worse.
Photo credit: Matthew Rutledge, CC BY 2.0.
If you remember my “everything I had to go through to get health insurance for 2017” post from last week, you might remember that I had to decide whether I wanted to continue with Premera even though my OB-GYN (the only doctor I visit regularly, for my annual Well Woman checkup) was no longer in-network.
Everything I Had to Go Through to Get Healthcare for 2017
This process has too many steps.thebillfold.com
I decided that I had very little control over whether I got to keep my OB-GYN; even if I did the work of figuring out which healthcare plan (if any) covered him, he could still retire, or move, or something could happen. Better to stick with Premera, since I’ve never had any really bad experiences and it’s also the major insurer in the area.
I didn’t think about checking to confirm which other doctors weren’t covered by my 2017 Premera plan, but it looks like there’s going to be a lot of them.
Here’s an excerpt from a letter I just received:
Over the last several months, Providence Health & Services and its partners, Swedish, PacMed and Kadlec have worked with Premera Blue Cross to sign a three-year contract for Premera Heritage Plus, an employer-sponsored health benefits plan. However, it is important that our patients know the following:
The agreement does not include Premera’s Heritage Prime plan, or Premera’s individual networks, Heritage Signature and LifeWise Connect, both of which are available on the Washington Health Benefit Exchange.
If you’re not a Seattle resident, you should understand that this is huge. I am effectively cut off from several of the major hospitals and medical facilities in the city.
So I went back and looked at my 2017 healthcare plan. If I were to visit an out-of-network provider, I would pay the full costs out-of-pocket, and my payment would neither decrease my $4,500 deductible nor my $7,150 annual out-of-pocket limit. There’s an exception for emergency services, which come with a $250 copay followed by payment out of my $4,500 deductible.
I also looked at which hospitals and medical services might still be available to me—which is not information that is very easily presented, I should tell you right now—and it looks like I’ll still be able to get medical care in Seattle, plus my local ZoomClinic is part of my plan, which should cover a lot of the care I anticipate needing (and help connect me to other healthcare services in my network as necessary).
So this isn’t a complete disaster.
But it’s still information I would have liked to have a month ago.

Partnering with SafeShare to create the Ad-hoc Insurance of the Sharing Economy

The sharing economy presents different challenges to those of the rental sector. Traditional insurance excludes property damages by paying guests and household insurance does not cover damage from third parties, amongst other limitations.
Slock.it’s technology enables anything from lockers to villas to be rented in an ad-hoc, peer to peer fashion, hopefully one day on the Universal Sharing Network. For small items, the built-in deposit system will be often sufficient, but for higher value property, such as vehicles, office spaces or apartments, we have partnered with SafeShare to provide future users of the Universal Sharing Network with a leading insurance product.
Because it supports almost any use case in so many countries, SafeShare is an ideal partner for Slock.it
With SafeShare, Universal Sharing Network smart contracts will be able to offer a revolutionary , universal, on-the-spot insurance where users pay only for the type of insurance they need, when they need it. The insurance provider will read from the Ethereum blockchain when the objects are rented out, and owners will only pay for the time the property was required.
The simplicity and elegance of the implementation of the insurance mechanism prototype we are developing with SafeShare would surprise many — it is worlds away from the horribly expensive, slow to implement SOA frameworks from traditional integrators. In many respect, it’s a perfect example of how blockchain technology creates new business opportunities while reducing the cost of operations for the companies that adopt it.
We encourage you to learn more about SafeShare and their amazing team on their website: http://safeshareinsurance.com/

CoverWallet: Reinventing business insurance with new investors and executives
We just raised $7.8M & added Jim Ermilio as President of Insurance

We have some exciting things to share.
I am delighted to announce our Series A round of $7.8M which will help us continue to build an online insurance company optimized for today’s busy business owner. The round, led by Union Square Ventures, included new investor Index Ventures, and previous investors Highland Capital Partners, Two Sigma Ventures and Founder Collective. In addition, we are announcing that seasoned executive Jim Ermilio is joining CoverWallet as President of Insurance.
This comes just a few weeks after being selected as one of the most entrepreneurial companies in America by Entrepreneur360.
Why we are excited about this announcement:
We’re welcoming two new investors that have an incredible track record of partnering with tech startups to reinvent (or create) large markets: Union Square Ventures (investors in Twitter, Indeed, Duolingo, LendingClub, Zynga, FundingCircle, Tumblr, MongoDB, or Twilio) and Index Ventures (investors in Dropbox, CundyCrush, Slack, Transferwise, Metromile, Wealthfront, or Skype). Index’s investment was led by Ilya Fushman, a partner at Index and a personal friend.
John Buttrick, a partner at Union Square Ventures, has joined our board. John led USV investments in successful financial services startups such as FundingCircle, LendingClub, RealtyShares, SigFig and C2FO.
Jim Ermilio, previously CEO of online auto insurance company Goji and Executive Vice President and General Counsel at Commerce Insurance (acquired for over $2B), has joined as President of Insurance. We are extremely fortunate because it is rare to find a successful executive with experience in tech, insurance and startups, and Jim brings that unique combination.
Big Opportunity in Insurance for Product & Customer-Centric Driven Organizations
At CoverWallet we combine data, design and technology to simplify how businesses deal with their insurance needs.
When I talk to executives from the insurance industry, it seems they all agree that customers feel that dealing with insurance is analog and frustrating. The industry needs to use design and technology to develop customer-centric online products and simplify the user experience.
But only a few of them walk the walk. I am always surprised to hear from some insurance executives that you shouldn’t make it too easy for a customer to shop for policies digitally. Their suggestion is that “you need to make it painful upfront to identify who is a real buyer” (!!). Other executives may tell you that they are committed to building simple and beautiful experiences for the customers, but when you ask how many product designers (graphic designers, interaction designers, usability managers, information architects, analytics managers) they have on payroll the answer is 0 (as a note, so far we have 3 UI designers at Coverwallet).
I have even heard from an executive that customers don’t care about an easy and elegant experience because they need the insurance and will go through whatever experience you put them through. They neglect any prioritization or resource allocation to good product design.

This is where the opportunity is. Research shows that new billion dollar companies generally reinvent existing behavior with a superior consumer experience based on data, design and technology, rather than bringing something radical and novel to the market. Morgan Stanley and BCG forecast that 20% of the insurance industry is going to move online, meaning that product-focused organizations, with design and technology in their DNA, have a great chance to reinvent the industry and capture this opportunity. So far, we are fortunate to have partnered with a handful of insurance companies who understand that the world is changing and you need to move forward in order to remain relevant.
“Insurers know that many small businesses in the US will eventually buy insurance directly online. What insurers don’t appreciate is how fast this shift is likely to happen”, Morgan Stanley / BCG report, Apr 2016
When I look back, I am impressed by the quality of individuals and firms who have joined CoverWallet so far, starting with my cofounder Rashmi Melgiri, and including employees, advisors, investors and partners, and I feel extremely fortunate. And I’m excited for the next twelve months, as we continue developing the tech platform, growing the team and the metrics, and reinventing this large industry, to simplify the life of every business owner.

Fixing insurance distribution: three schools of approach
I have met a lot of insuretech businesses over the last couple of years, mostly in Europe but with a burst in the US around Insuretech Connect
The majority of these businesses are trying to find a new way to reach and acquire customers (be they consumers or businesses). There are a bunch of other interesting areas in insurance around software, claims management, fraud, capital structure, broker tools etc. — but I will save that for another post.
Any VC looking across many companies in a sector needs to find a way to impose structure and differentiate between approaches. This can be tough as there are lot of common threads.

Many companies talk to me about their use of machine learning; new data sources; flexible SaaS platforms; ability to iterate product much more rapidly than incumbents and mobile-first approach. Many companies want to start with a broker model and evolve to an MGA, often involving partnering with a reinsurer (usually Munich Re, but others are catching up). Most companies want to improve the claims process. No-one wants to rely on adwords for acquisition.
What I try to do is find important axes on which startups differ. Lots of ways to look at this but I find myself coming back to the following:
Concierge vs. Bundling vs. Pull
One school of startups want to become your trusted concierge for all your insurance needs. Insurance is a world that most of us don’t fully understand, and we want to outsource decision making to a third party. Once they have built our trust we will happily buy all our insurance through them, creating long lifetimes, and amortizing acquisition cost across many different products.
The second school of startups see this as wishful thinking. They see insurance as a low-engagement purchase which is almost always triggered by a major purchase or life event. The obvious way to sell such a product is by bundling it in at point of purchase. Any other acquisition channel will over time become too expensive (who sells warranties as a standalone product?). If they resist the temptation to reduce coverage or jack up prices every year they should be able to fix for high churn.
The third, and smallest, school believe that you can get people to care enough about insurance that they will buy it proactively — pull not push.
None of the above schools is proven, and the right answer probably varies by line of business. Going into each of them in more depth:
Concierge
This is obviously the original insurance broker model, which continues to be strong in many countries and globally in business insurance.
The first disruption here was the price comparison websites, which work really well for ‘grudge purchase’ price-focussed insurance (e.g. car and home). There is still plenty of mileage in PCWs. The UK and Germany are the only large mature markets, with multiple $B+ businesses created: Moneysupermarket, Check24, Confused and Compare the Market. The US market is evolving rapidly here with the likes of Coverhound and Compare.com. CompareAsia and CompareEurope are rolling out rapidly across markets. Starting to get traction in SMB sector as well with the lies of SimplyBusiness.
The next evolution of this is the ‘online advisor’ which takes a more detailed look at your personal circumstances and recommends what cover you should and shouldn’t have, then helps you buy it. PolicyGenius seem to be making this work well for life insurance. Embroker and Coverwallet are taking on the SMB market.

Taking that a step further are the ‘mobile insurance wallets’ such as Financefox, Knip, Safe, Brolly and Clark. They start by pulling all your insurance policies into one place, then they make personalised recommendations to you to improve your cover. Currently fairly manually but automating and adding AI over time.
The end game would be an AI that could pull all your insurance together in one place, optimise it on your behalf, and only ask for the occasional approval (“Congratulations on your new baby Rob. I would recommend to increase your life insurance by 25%”). Or it could be an ‘umbrella’ policy covering all your risks in a more cost-effective way.
The common challenges in this area are:
Insurers being uncooperative. Mostly as they are protecting their broker channels. Also as they worry about being commoditised. Need to show them the potential for real revenue upside.
Building consumer trust in a cost-effective way. Requires a perfect product, over-communication, and a bit of brand-building
Maintaining that trust over time. Claims process is vital, as is price transparency and competitiveness
Bundling
In this model insurance is bundled in at point of sale. The art (and science) is in making this as smooth as possible, to maximise conversion rate and size of sale. An analogy I use here is PSPs such as Adyen and Stripe, which have taken share from the likes of first-gen PSPs such as Worldpay. The other opportunity is in expanding PoS insurance to new categories.
The first big category here has been extended warranties and product insurance, which made Asurion and Assurant big companies. Simplesurance are the leading European player.

The real stand out player so far is Zhong An who have achieved phenomenal traction for their return shipping insurance through Taobao and Tmall: Four billion policies sold since they started in 2013.
Travel insurance has been a lucrative area for OTAs, but has often been done through direct partnerships with insurers. Covermore probably the biggest player, with newer entrants including Hepstar and Covergenius.
Other sectors are opening up for this as they move the purchase online. Cross-selling insurance offline was tricky as it involved paperwork and an untrained person giving regulated advice. Online channels really open this up. It will be fascinating to see what online new car sales and connected cars do to sales of auto insurance at point of purchase. Several of the big auto manufacturers seem to be gearing up for this.
The other opportunity opening up is cross-selling insurance through employee portals and benefits providers. Zenefits the obvious example but others such as Alan in France will be interesting to watch
The biggest challenge for the bundlers is competitive differentiation. What stops their partners shopping around every two years for lowest margins? Can they find exclusive pricing, build an ‘intel inside’ type brand, or create a portable profile for users? Can they build the widest and fastest set of integrations with insurers’ back ends? Can they build new products that stand out from the crowd?
The other challenge is avoiding the temptation to slip into selling poor or expensive insurance products. PPI insurance sales in the UK are a cautionary tale.
Pull
This is the most ambitious and hardest model.

Trov is the stand out example to date, with $46M of funding. Their aim is to bring millennials into the insurance world by getting them to insure the products they love with a mobile app experience that they also love. However recent comments by the CEO that they are also building a platform for other insurers seem to indicate a desire to hedge against this not working out.
Lemonade is the other obvious example, offering a strong price and great on-boarding experience to woo young people into buying renters insurance.
The best circumstance for any pull model is a market disruption that generates renewed interest in insurance. Oscar benefitted here from Obamacare. Telematics car insurance benefitted from soaring premiums for young drivers. Cyberinsurance is the current hot category in business insurance.
The challenge is obvious — getting customers to care. We need to always remember that insurance is a long way down most people’s to-do list.
I am agnostic on which of the above will produce the next $B success story. All three approaches have potential and am interested to hear from European insurtech startups in all of them (and from those which are hard to categorise).

My Fuck Off Fund Is Insurance Against My Own Good Intentions
It’s there to sort of save me from myself.
Photo: Unsplash
Talking at length about how busy you are is a surefire way to prune your friend group without doing any of the work. One conversation about how the week is really packed easily slides into a ceaseless monologue, a logorrhea about nothing particularly interesting to anyone else except yourself. I find myself checking this tendency often. I work a lot of hours and my free time is limited; the former is a point of pride tempered with a dose of reality and the latter is perhaps my main source of stress.
Working makes me money. Money makes it so that I can live my life in the manner I’d like to live it. Burnout prevents me from living my life to its fullest and is a direct result of the amount of work I do. As an insurance policy against my inevitable collapse, when my left eye twitch takes over my entire face or when I finally snap, I cultivate my fuck off fund as valuable insurance against my own good intentions.
If left to my own devices and faced with a future of financial uncertainty, I will schedule more work than I can comfortably do in order to stave off the panic that comes from never having work again. Freelancing means that the work could suddenly stop; it is imperative to do all the work I can while I have it, so that when I don’t, my time is less panicked and more restorative.
Right now, I have about $18,789 in my second checking account and $717 in my actual, brand-new savings account. That’s my Fuck Off Fund, my Fuck I Have To Pay Taxes Fund, my I’d Love To Take A Month Off Sometime Eventually Fund. It’s the whole banana stand. It’s the insurance policy I’ve built from the ground up, money that I can use in the case of an emergency. It’s a Fuck Off Fund that I can use when I need to tell myself to fuck off from work if I need to for my own sanity.
Not working makes me anxious because it makes me consider my usefulness. I like keeping busy and participating in the elaborate system required to make money in order to live. I like money. I like having it and I like the security it embodies: If I have money, I have freedom. I can move in the world in a way that works for me and the money I’ve made will allow me to do so. That, in its own right, is the point of a Fuck Off Fund: to be able to have the freedom to wriggle out from under the thumb of whatever exterior force is preventing you from living your life to the fullest. It’s not always that easy, but sometimes throwing money at a problem is the simplest solution. Having money to throw at that problem, whether it be burnout or a broken computer or a sprained ankle, is a privilege. It’s something I never thought I’d have. And now, somehow, I do.
I could work less — drop a job or an assignment here and there and free up time for myself to do whatever it is I need to do — but I find it very hard to turn down work that I am capable of doing, regardless of whether or not I have the time. An easy assignment for $200, something that will take me maybe two hours, is hard to turn down. Adding it to the pile and forging ahead, even though the pile is already starting to collapse under its own weight, is easy. It’s money in the bank. It’s something that makes my imagined time away from work that much easier. A bill will get paid because I do this work; I will be able to breathe easy for one extra day. I won’t have to open my laptop. I will pretend the internet and its attendant crises have fallen into the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, never to be seen again. I will float on for another day, buoyed by the money I’ve saved, quietly telling myself to fuck off.
This week, we’re celebrating the Fuck Off Fund. This story is part of this series.

HOLY SHIT. I’m losing my ACA Marketplace Insurance Plan in 30 days.

I am one of 200,000 New Yorkers who recently discovered my Health Republic plan is going under in 2016. I’ve been scrambling to find a new plan that covers my doctors.
About Me: I am a disability advocate. My advocacy aims to ease the stigma of products used by people with disabilities. I believe a reduction in stigma will save countless lives. I am also a trained Navigator and will be spending a better part of November volunteering for Community Health Advocates helping my fellow New Yorkers understand their marketplace options… yet I cannot seem to navigate my own healthcare situation.
Here is a recent post about my health insurance experience:
My Health Insurance Just Shut Down Operations. I’m Scared.
But HOLY SHIT.
This was just released by New York State (on Friday, October 29th):
However, a subsequent NYDFS and CMS-led review of Health Republic’s finances has found that the company’s financial condition is substantially worse than the company previously reported in its filings to NYDFS. In light of these developments, NYDFS and the NYSOH Marketplace have determined that it is in the best interest of consumers to end all Health Republic policies — both individual and small group — on November 30, 2015 so that customers can transition to new coverage after that date.
I’m losing my health insurance in 30 days and I don’t know what to do.
I only have 15 days to select a new plan.
I live with chronic illness and disability. I see my doctors at least weekly. There is no other plan that carries my entire medical team (3 doctors). This honestly could kill me. I can’t be any more clear. I need help. Somebody needs to step in to ensure those who require continuity of care get it. How could this have happened?
Update: I just received the following (and incredibly warm) message from my contact at Health Republic. Remember this is someone who is in the process of losing her job.
They’re shutting us down… We will no longer provide or have insurance after November.
On Monday, I will send over any information I can gather. I am almost positive the NY exchange will have additional assistance available as well as support from DFS… Remain optimistic. You may be able to keep the providers you’re currently visiting for a bit of time after our “doors have closed”.
This may be insanity, and it certainly seems… Unjust… But keep in mind, everything happens for a reason. This door may be closing just as another will be opening.
11/1/15 UPDATE: Knowing I only have 15 days to select a new plan, I logged into NY State of Health as soon as the new marketplace plans went up this morning and discovered I’m locked out. Due to a glitch from 2013, I have two separate accounts. I was assured this was fixed, it’s not.
The account I use says this:

The other account says this:

NYState of Health offices are closed on Sundays. Guess I only have 14 days.
11/2/15 UPDATE: There was a series of Marketplace outages today meaning New Yorkers struggled to get logged on and start shopping. It is also becoming increasingly evident that most Health Republic insurees have yet to be notified they need to sign up for new coverage in just 13 days.
The plan is discontinuing 11/30, not 12/31.
11/3/15 UPDATE: I am now logged onto the New York Marketplace. I found a plan that could work, it’s an Oscar plan as I assumed would be the case. Unfortunately while both of my doctors assure me they accept Oscar, I was unable to locate either of them in Oscar’s doctor search.

Furthermore, I still have not received official notification from Health Republic, which means the majority of Health Republic insurees remain unaware they need to select a new plan in 12 days. I thought the Marketplace would have a warning, but this was the best I got:

11/3/15 Another UPDATE: This is a fiasco. I just spoke with my contact at New York State of Health. She informed me I was no longer eligible for subsidies on any marketplace plans (I receive $285 a month in subsidies because I am on SSD). I became Medicare eligible on 6/1 and turned down Medicare Part B. At the time I was happy with my Health Republic plan and didn’t want to lose my medical team. There were (and are) no Medicare plans that cover all my doctors.
In order for me to receive my subsidies, I need to get rid of Medicare Part A. I was forced onto Medicare Part A. And to get rid of Part A means I will need to also come off of Social Security Disability, which is my source of income and how I pay for my healthcare.
To get back onto Medicare part B, I will need to pay a steep penalty every month for the rest of my life because I declined it in the first place. But none of my doctors accept the same Medicare plan.
I need help.
11/4/14 UPDATE: I received an unexpected and incredibly warm call from a nurse at Oscar Health. She understood the importance of continuity of care regarding mental health physicians. She knew how strong and influential a psychologist and patient bond can be, especially in patients with chronic conditions. So she said Oscar would be more than happy to cover my out of network psychologist. I had chosen Oscar because they covered my two other doctors (my Neurologist and General Practitioner).
Unfortunately the nurse told me Oscar and New York Presbyterian are parting ways. This means my GP and Neurologist will no longer be covered by Oscar in 2016. New York Presbyterian is renowned for being one of the top ten best hospitals in the world, the best in NYC and yet it won’t be covered by an NYC health insurance plan. There are no other Marketplace plans that cover both my GP and my Neurologist. So even had I been an Oscar insuree from day one, I still would be losing continuity of care come 2016.
I also learned I am not eligible for New York’s new and affordable Essential Plan because I am Medicare eligible. And lastly, I am not eligible for Medicaid, though a Medicaid SpendDown plan might be an option (that is, if it doesn’t cost me more than a Marketplace plan without the subsidies).
11/6/15 UPDATE: First, it just came to my attention that the shuttering of Health Republic means there are now no Marketplace plans that cover Memorial Sloane Kettering, which is the best cancer hospital in the world.

In regards to my personal story. I just had a conversation with a Medicare expert. Apparently there have not been any data matches between Medicare and Marketplace plans because a system was in place to notify Health Republic that I (unwillingly) became eligible for Medicare Part A. Having Medicare Part A means I have the minimal required coverage, and come tax time I am S.O.L. How this is my fault that the system wasn’t properly set up? Not entirely sure… but I think I’m about to get a lot broker.
Because I’m already in this precarious tax situation, my new Medicare expert friend urged me not to re-run my Marketplace application, as re-running it might cause the system to match data and take away the subsidies that I currently am shown that I’m eligible for. Taking advantage of this systemic flaw will mean I can receive coverage for the month of December from Oscar (even if it will make my tax situation even worse).

As I was emailing with my new Medicare expert friend, I received a call from my (incredibly kind) contact at New York State of Health asking me to reach out before the end of the day so we can re-run my application and start looking into Medicaid Spend Down options. I’m not sure what I am going to do yet. But I am so grateful to see there may be an enrollment extension in the works.
I’m also thrilled to announce that I got a call from Senator Carlucci’s office. David Carlucci is my favorite Senator in New York because he brought the Accessible Icon to New York State. He is passionate both about People with Disabilities and easing Mental Health stigma. It relieves me to no end knowing this is now on his radar.

Please check out my list of #AffordableCareAsks (and please feel free to get in touch and submit your own).
11/7/15 UPDATE: The New York Times is covering my story!

11/7/15 Another UPDATE: If you can make sense of this Tweet, you will discover you have until November 30th to select a new plan for December.

Click here for the entire Twitter conversation. Took me a while to understand, but basically it would be difficult to notify users, via the New York State of Health website that they would need to indicate they were applying through a Special Enrollment Period (SEP) instead of an Open Enrollment period (OEP). And to have users facing an SEP alongside an OEP might be confusing. So, instead New York state is telling all Health Republic insurees they have until the November 15th (taking 15 enrollment days away from consumers) to avoid confusion.
11/7/15 UPDATE: New York state is stepping in. The official November 15th deadline has been moved back to November 30th. There will be an application hotline for those applying after the 15th. There will be steps put in place that allow Health Republic consumers to continue coverage at New York Presbyterian and Memorial Sloane Kettering for up to a year, since no other marketplace plan covers NYP or MSK.
But it still doesn’t resolve the Medicare issues that came to light through this ordeal. I am still virtually uninsurable as of 2016 and will have to ‘trick the system’ to maintain coverage for the month of December.
My focus for the week of 11/9/15 will be dis-enrollment from Medicare Part A without losing my SSD benefits so I can maintain continuity of care.
Update 11/9/2015: I received the below message from my friend Barry. Barry has a condition a lot like mine, though his actually has a name. CIDP. In reading this, you will notice two things. First, Barry is a tried and true Texas Republican (I am neither). Second, the desire to opt out of Medicare Part A crosses partisan lines.
I saw this in the Times today and I share your frustration. I’m facing similar problems. Since I’ve been granted SSDI (which I was contractually required to apply for under my contract with my private disability insurer), I’m required to enroll in Medicare. Never mind that I don’t want Medicare because it provides worse coverage of my IVIG therapy (at a greater cost to me, out of pocket) than I could get from a private insurer. It amazes me that the government forces me to accept its “benefit,” even when I’d be much better off (as would the taxpayers) without it.
Meanwhile, since it’s illegal for me to buy group health insurance through the Texas bar, I also can’t insure my wife and kids that way. So they’re stuck with the ACA exchange policies, none of which is accepted by their doctors. So now we’re scrambling to find a new pediatrician and a new endocrinologist for my son, who’s a type 1 diabetic and sees his doctor very frequently. If we can’t manage that by January — and we’ve been trying for over a month, now — our only option will be to take him to the ER for his routine diabetes care, which happens, on average, twice a month. He’ll miss a full day of school, my wife will miss a day of work, and the cost will be many times what it would be under a rational system.
It’s hard to argue that the pre-Obamacare system made much sense, but it’s also hard to argue this is much better. At least the old system didn’t come with a trillion dollar price tag.
Note, BTW, that I’ve been practicing law for 11 years and I nonetheless find the Medicare rules as opaque as if they were written in ancient Sumerian. How an average senior can be expected to navigate them is beyond me.
11/11/15 UPDATE: I am speaking with a wonderful representative at The Medicare Rights Center who is helping me figure out the best Part B plan to enroll in. Our agreed upon first step was something I was not comfortable doing, but I had to ask my Psychologist to become a Medicare provider. The rep at MRC suggested I provide this form to my Psychologist and she is currently reviewing and considering it.
In speaking with my psychologist about this, I listed off a variety of reasons I thought she may not be comfortable becoming a Medicare provider. As she is good at her job, she doesn’t let on her thinking, but I can’t imagine I’m far off. The main reason was, I never see elderly people come and go from her office. It is probably not her specialty. Most of her patients are my age. How does a psychologist attract clientele within one’s specialty? This is something this whole experience has made me feel very curious about.
Another thing I’ve become curious about? Why, when you Google ‘Medicare’ and click on images are the only people you see elderly? What about me? Young Medicare recipients? I don’t feel like this system is made for me.
11/13/15 UPDATE: My psychologist reviewed the materials and decided not to become a Medicare provider. I feel both scared shitless and more dedicated than ever to maintaining my medical team and advocating for a Medicare opt out for SSD recipients. But currently, things feel very dire and I’m I worry it’s going to make me sick.
11/14/15 UPDATE: During tonight’s Democratic Debate, Hillary Clinton said we need to find ways to improve the ACA.
Dear Brian Fallon, Stephanie Hannon, Jennifer Palmieri, Hillary for Iowa,Christina Reynolds, Ginger Lew, Karen Finney, Jess Morales Rocketto, Ann O’Leary, and David Plouffe I could not agree more and would love her support in making changes so Medicare/Marketplace plans work for me.

11/17/15 UPDATE: I still haven’t resolved anything and have started to fall into a depression caused by my inability to secure a plan that covers my psychologist. Is this a Catch-22 or just hell?
11/18/15 UPDATE: My psychologist will not be eligible for any Medicare PPO plans because she is not a contracted provider. Isn’t a PPO, by nature, supposed to cover doctors that aren’t contracted? So frustrated. I had gotten my hopes up about this plan.
12/3/15 UPDATE: Things just took a really bad turn. I just heard from the Medicare Rights Center and Senator Gillibrand’s Office, and the SSA denied my equitable relief request that they submitted on my behalf. They were shocked and I’m floored. I am now ineligible both for Medicare and for Marketplace Subsidies.
12/7/15 UPDATE: Today is the Medicare enrollment deadline. It will pass without me.
12/22/15 UPDATE: I just received a letter from Health Republic stating I owe $608.48. They will not pay my provider’s final claim until I pay this amount. I wrote a post in May detailing a billing issue that I believed had been resolved. It had not been resolved. When I try to call the provided number, it’s incredibly difficult to get through to customer service. And when I do get through to customer service, they immediately transfer me to The New York State Department of Financial Services. It’s mind boggling. I canNOT figure out how to resolve this issue to get my doctor paid. I worry this could hurt my credit.
12/29/15 UPDATE: Grandma’s Advice came in the mail:

1/19/16 UPDATE: It’s been a little while since my last update. I’m so grateful that Oscar and my psychologist came to an out of network coverage agreement, so I get to keep my doctor. I still am not receiving subsidies. This means that even though my neurologist is covered (until April when Oscar drops New York Presbyterian) I can’t afford to go. In other random news, I was invited to The White House to speak about my advocacy (unrelated to insurance woes) and brought my letter from Nonie were I to perchance run into the President. I didn’t run into the President. But here’s the video of my speech (my first ever public talk) at The White House:


New Evidence That Obamacare Helped Millions of Kids Get Health Insurance
A new analysis finds the rate of uninsured kids in America fell by almost half since the Affordable Care Act was passed.

Since Obamacare took effect, many more children in the United States have gotten health insurance, according to a new analysis. In 2008, 9 percent of kids under the age of 18 in America — that’s 6.9 million children — didn’t have health insurance. By 2015, that number had fallen to 3.5 million children, or 5 percent of the country’s kids. Children from families just above poverty level tended to see the biggest gains, but children of all income levels saw improvement recently.
The provisions of Obamacare were mostly designed to help low-income adults—not kids—get health insurance. Children were already covered by Medicaid and by the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which was established in 1997. But the Affordable Care Act may still have helped cover some kids, one of the analysis’ authors, public-policy researcher Joan Alker of Georgetown University wrote last year. Some children may have benefited from a marketplace plan. Others might have gotten insurance because the act lowered the premiums low-income parents in some states had to pay to cover their older kids.
The numbers come at a time when the Affordable Care Act is suffering from rising costs and from major insurers pulling out of the individual marketplace. Hillary Clinton has proposed changes to the law, while Donald Trump has promised to repeal it altogether. What these changes will mean for the coverage rates for kids remains to be seen.







Making insurance human again.
I believe insurance is exciting. I kind of hope you disagree; at least, I’m aware many do. I have rather a unique perspective I think. Let me start from there.
Monetary insurance as we know it, is, in fact, centuries old and its basis, trust, is even older. Mutual aid (a second strand of insurance), the theory that if my house burns down, my neighbours will help rebuild, and I theirs, underpins the core of what insurance is, and can even be said to form a vital tool of society.
Both insurance types have common traits. They’ve evolved through necessity, through the experience that bad stuff happens, and when it does we do something, commit to something, to reduce the pain, suffering or financial loss should it happen again. An obvious example might be the Great Fire of London in 1666. The destruction of 13,000 homes in 4 days very quickly led to fire insurance becoming a far more urgent product. An insurance office was included in Sir Christopher Wren’s rebuilding plans the next year and sometime after that, 5000 homes were insured with a primitive form of fire insurance offering the promise of reimbursement in the event of total loss through fire.
When I think about insurance I think of it as a feeling, an emotion. It’s about sensing that I’m safe in the event of ‘the worst’ happening. It’s an assurance that I’ll be looked after, that I can care for my family and that my investments are protected if we are unfortunate enough to suffer a catastrophic event, something beyond our control. I rely on a financial institution offering me protection for a price. Like us all, I’m paying for my assured, confident, organised emotion. I’m in control.
The reality is I’m not in control, I don’t feel organised and I’m not confident. For me, insurance is broken.
I’ve been on the receiving end of those unfortunate events and it didn’t work. I lived in a flat in south London that was broken into, a simple thing really; thieves kicked the door in, ransacked the place and stole everything. Despite the fact that the windows were untouched, my insurance provider refused to pay — my fault, I’d replaced a window lock with a more modern version. On that basis — despite the windows being locked and completely secure, there was no payout. The lock wasn’t the right type, they told me. It was a horrific experience my family went through. I can still remember the emotions as clearly as if it were today. It wasn’t the last time I’d feel let down by insurance.
When I first came across insurance I was probably about 6 and it confused me. My Dad ran a small Life and Pensions company. He was an IFA, part of a wider family business of insurance brokers. He’d often ask me to fetch ‘risk data’ from a big room of files. I asked him one day what risks were, as my only other experience of the word came from the board game I’d discovered through my boyish love of anything war related, that or falling off the climbing frame. My dad explained risks were files containing information about people that had purchased policies. I remember being dismissed, as an inquisitive child often is, when I asked him why he didn’t call them people. His response ran along the lines of “It’s just the way it is, they are risks”.
It didn’t make much sense then, but neither did a lot of things. I was 6.
Maybe this is where things might have gone awry. I understand it of course, but calling customers ‘risks’ feels wrong. It distances everything from the fact that at the bottom of the risk is a person, a family, all of whom, like me, rely on their insurance. We buy a product in the hope we will never need it, purchased as it is for an emotional feeling and the reassurance of security.
A few years later, in my adolescent teens, I remember being stopped in the street by a man whom I’d never met before. He asked how I was, how my Dad was, and this wasn’t the first time that had happened. You see, over the years my family had built a business that insured not an insignificant proportion of my hometown, and many people knew me, not personally but as a relative of the people that looked after their insurance.
There was a simple exchange happening in that brief conversation. Someone from the company my family owned, possibly a relative of mine, talked to that person regularly. That discussion was about the family, the home in which it lived, the possessions within it. It was a friendly exchange, sometimes even done over a coffee in the front room. There’d be talk about the local area, the car, home, family, pets, holiday destinations. Hopes for children could be discussed as well as health problems. In fact, lives would be opened and in return, my family’s business would provide advice and guidance on how to best ensure the right products were purchased. Most customers didn’t even know the name of the company insuring them; they didn’t need to. All was taken care of. If there was a problem, any problem, they called and if they didn’t call, we’d check on them regularly. Being a local broker, of course, helped; the business also knew the local plumber, the local electrician, the local builders, and probably did their insurance too.
When I was stopped in the street, it was an extension of that conversation. Customers felt they knew me too. Of course, being a grumpy adolescent teenager at the time, I didn’t understand and was probably more worried about the batteries in my walkman. It happened a lot, I got used to it.
For many reasons in the last 50 years insurance has changed. People have become busier and there’s less time for the regular catch up. The final disconnect, I believe, between customers and the personal, emotional interaction was the advent of comparison. Price became the biggest motivator, and people accepted buying direct as the norm. The experience was simplified. However, cheaper deals meant less interaction, and the emotions never went away.
I’ll admit I’m not as organised as I should be. I get by, do the minimum, but there’s a constant feeling that I could be more in control, that I’m about to get bitten because I’ve omitted to do something I probably should have. I feel as though I never know when something is coming, I have a rough idea of course, but ask me when my MOT is due and I probably won’t know without looking it up. It’s probably in the pile of paperwork that’s sitting in my kitchen, the one I really should be sorting out tonight!
For me, I wish I had that personal service, I don’t really have time for a coffee though and I’d be suspicious of anyone who wanted to come round and talk to me these days. But I haven’t forgotten the service that my family provided. I wish someone was helping me take care of it all. I’ve got more insurance, but it’s a huge hassle getting quotes from everywhere when it all runs out.
My family sold the business in the end. Back then, the technology simply didn’t exist to scale such a customer focused approach efficiently and the drive for lower prices made the long-term future seem less viable.
In the last year, I’ve been lucky enough to have been given the opportunity to build something that evoked many memories from those childhood days. It’s a new product, a product that offers the benefits of reminding me when I need to do something, fetches all my policies (with a little help), finds me a good deal and helps me make sure I’m covered for the things I need. It’s a product that will, over time, learn more about my family and will then use the knowledge of all its customers, and the market, to let me know if there’s something that might be useful to me. It’s a product that is independent of insurers, built by people that know what insurance really should be, and who want to put the emotion back.
I’m not alone here. The single biggest innovation in the industry in recent years is the realisation that customers come first; they’re calling it service, but that’s better than risk.
The product we’re building? It’s called Simples. It’s exciting — I’d love it if you’d take a look and let me know if we’re getting it right.

It’s Time to Play “How Much More Will Health Insurance Cost Next Year?”
Everybody’s a winner!
Photo credit: Clever Cupcakes, CC BY 2.0.
Last year, my Bronze health insurance plan increased its monthly premiums by 12 percent ($219.38 to $245.69). My deductible stayed the same, at $5,250, and my out-of-pocket maximum was $6,100.
You might remember me going over all of these numbers last fall:
Open Enrollment Has Started, and My Options Are Worse This Year
We’re three days into the Affordable Care Act Open Enrollment, and I am already unhappy with my choices.thebillfold.com
All care except for my annual wellness exam comes out of my deductible first; once that’s paid down, I’ll pay 20 percent of the cost and my provider will pay the other 80. I hit my out-of-pocket maximum at $6,100.
In other words, I’m paying $2,948.28 over the course of the year for the privilege of only having to pay $6,100 towards any medical costs.
Well, fall’s back, and so are rising health insurance costs. Here’s a letter I received from my health insurance provider:

I like how this letter—like so many aspects of health insurance—is unnecessarily confusing. One sentence reads “we won’t offer the health insurance coverage you currently have,” and another reads “Premera is continuing to offer your health coverage for the next year.”
The letter also advises me to visit WAHealthPlanFinder.org to learn more about my new health plan options, but after going through the trouble of logging into WAHealthPlanFinder and choosing a new password that didn’t contain any dictionary words (which, cOm3 @n), I learned that WAHealthPlanFinder hadn’t made its 2017 information available, and that I should check back.
Then I went to Premera’s website and found exactly what I was looking for: next year, my Bronze plan’s monthly premium will increase by 19 percent to $293.08, and I’ll have two deductibles: $4,500 for medical, and $1,500 for pharmacy. My out-of-pocket maximum will jump up to $7,150.
To do the same math as I did last year: in 2017, I’ll pay $3,516.96 for the privilege of only having to pay $7,150 towards any medical costs.
Let’s hope I have a very healthy year.
Have any of you gotten similar health insurance letters? How much are your costs going to increase in 2017?

The Cost of Getting My Eyes Checked Without Insurance
Even though I’m sure my prescription hasn’t changed.
Photo: elston
As of late, I have been consumed with the idea of new glasses. I’ve been wearing glasses since I was a kid and it is only recently that I discovered that buying glasses is a really fun way to spend money — buying clothes, but for my face! No one really needs new glasses unless the glasses they currently own are broken. My glasses are just fine. They spend a lot of time being slowly crushed to death under my slumbering form, as I apparently remove them in the middle of the night when I fall asleep reading and place them directly under my body for safekeeping.
This habit means that they’re a little worse for wear and so I would like new ones. Also, the idea of having glasses that actually stay on my face is appealing to me. Recently glasses manufacturers have started making glasses for people with a “low nose bridge.” Perhaps the bridge of my nose is low, or maybe my cheeks are very big or I honestly couldn’t tell you what the deal is, but glasses refuse to stay on my face and slide down my nose and it drives me bonkers. I was convinced it was a hoax, some sort of marketing trick that I was eager to fall for, but I tried on a pair of glasses with a low nose bridge, they cost $95 (thanks for looking out for us, Warby Parker), and when I marched up to the counter to buy them, I was informed that my prescription was expired.
I don’t have vision insurance, which is fine for the most part. My semi-annual eye exam is nothing more than a confirmation that yes, I still need glasses. With insurance, the process is seamless, easy and nearly free. Without insurance, it’s a little bit different.
$132 for an eye exam that also includes a contact lens exam, scheduled on ZocDoc and confirmed by an employee. “It says here your insurance ran out on June 30, 2016,” she said gently on the phone. “Did you…know that?”
Yes, I knew that. Yes, I should’ve scheduled an eye appointment immediately after I lost my job, as well as a doctor’s appointment, a visit to the gynecologist, the dentist and maybe a chiropractor. Yes, I understand that this was not the smartest decision I could’ve made, but here we are.
My eye doctor is astonishingly efficient, a fact that I always forget and feel slightly concerned about after an eye exam (without dilation) lasts for about 10 minutes, max.
A possible $200 for contact lenses: There is a contact lens startup called Hubble that purports to disrupt contacts, offering daily contacts for $30 a month. $200 buys me a year’s supply of monthly contacts, which I remember to change monthly most of the time. Hubble costs more money, so we’ll see. Also, it feels weird to get my contacts from a place that doesn’t seem to be vetted by an eye doctor. (Correction: I have just learned that Hubble does indeed check with your eye doctor about your prescription, so joke’s on me.)
$95 for those glasses: I promise that I will take them off before I go to bed.
Total: $227, with a possible $200 extra if I decide to live my life unencumbered by spectacles.

Insurance on the Blockchain
In which I coin the term insure-bits and disrupt the entire insurance industry.
[NOTE: This is my own version of the same piece you can find on ConsenSys’ web site.]
For months, I’ve been conjuring up radical visions of a brave new decentralized world with use cases from robotic ants that explore the walls of buildings to what I call “programmable land,” to hospitals that run themselves without administrators and people voting on their cell phones. I’ve tried to think of a way to radically reshape insurance. Aside from the standard disintermediation story, I’ve been drawing a blank for months.
Until last week, when I hit upon an idea that may well change the nature of insurance within a decade. I explained it to some people in the insurance industry yesterday, and they took three pages of hand-written notes. I want to document it here so everyone can get the idea.
Tokens, Tokens Everywhere
I’m working on a project I call the Token Factory, which, although I’m considered a “friend of ConsenSys,” is not the same as ConsenSys’ version of the same name. ConsenSys’ project, which recently soft-launched along with MetaMask, the Ethereum browser add-on, is now available to help people make simple tokens. Mine is not yet online.
The goal is to build a web site anyone can come to, specify a new token, and have a bunch of them in his/her wallet fairly quickly. A token is a transferable unit of value within a system. It is governed by a single person, organization, or consortium. A rail is a token that crosses system boundaries easily. A currency is a token that is accepted by a large number of systems.
Today, we are building fairly simple tokens that represent things like tickets, local currencies, cars, baseball cards, cows, trees, the hours of a consultant’s time, etc. When you trade the token, the ownership (or use of) that thing transfers.
Tomorrow, using Ethereum, we’ll build smart tokens that have all their business logic and regulation compliance built in. And that’s what gets me thinking about insurance.
Insurance Balls
Think of the market for insurance. At the 30,000-foot level, it’s millions and millions of contracts that specify how much a buyer pays in premiums and how much an insurance company pays under what circumstances. These contracts are often complex and sticky — they are custom-made for each customer and each situation. Try making a change to one of your insurance contracts! It can take about as much effort as getting a new one altogether.
Now think of it differently. Think of the market for insurance products as broken into small modules, each of which fundamentally represents an investment. There’s an investor on one side; on the other side is a customer paying a premium, providing an income stream. And in the middle, there’s a specification of risk and payment under various circumstances. Think of these as balls of different colors, sizes, and types. In reality, there aren’t that many different kinds — a few dozen basic types should describe most situations. A policy, then, could be a particular combination of these balls to suit the requirements of a given customer at a given time — sort of like a customer putting the balls into a sack. We could replace our collections of contracts with virtual sacks of these balls.
So here’s the idea: Create tokens that represent small units of insurance, and then let customers come along and put all the units they want into their “insurance wallet.” A smallest unit, for example, could have a $10 monthly premium and pay out as much as, say, $10,000 if conditions are met. Now put these tokens into a marketplace where all investors and consumers can see them. This creates a liquid market with low spreads and no middlemen.
Of course, people wouldn’t choose these small units by hand — they would specify what coverage they want, and software can buy the tokens they need. The tokens trade at market price at all times, depending on various risk factors that can move prices up or down.
Insure-Bits
As a token gesture, I’m going to coin a new term: insure-bits. An insure-bit is a cryptographic token that represents an indivisible unit of insurance of some kind. Presumably, a consortium would taxonomize and standardize the formats for these tokens, so they can unambiguously represent legal contractual agreements. Taking a decentralizing step further, they would actually be legal contractual agreements. Customers and investors would aggregate insure-bits on a common exchange to build portfolios that suit them.
Once we have an insure-bit infrastructure and ecosystem, we get real-time dynamic allocation. That’s right — you could automatically have the exact combination of insurance you need at each moment, and that mix of insure-bits can vary according to circumstances. Your insurance bot could increase your homeowner’s insurance as it learns about potential storms, or it could add to your travel insurance if it knows you’ve just rented a motorcycle. If the value of one of your assets goes up (as determined by an oracle — see below), that could trigger the purchase of some more insure-bits. Keep in mind that dynamic allocation also involves dynamic pricing — you’ll find that the insurance you want to buy in a hurry may be significantly more expensive than before, when you didn’t need it.
The Google-ization of Insurance
In essence, this is what Google did to advertising. While advertisers were buying big media campaigns that included banner ads as part of the mix, Google broke every single search word down into its own little market and sold the words at market price. This is the atomization of advertising — by breaking everything down into the smallest possible unit, it’s easy for buyers to purchase what they want when they want it, and they can specify in fairly sophisticated ways how much they are willing to pay for various words under various conditions. Whatever insure-bits you have in your portfolio at the exact time of the fire, or the car accident, or the cancellation of your flight determines your payoff.
Similarly, the obligations these tiny tokens represent can be traded on the back end as well. They can be assembled, modeled, tested, collateralized, and securitized in real time to meet the needs of various investors. The fact that both investors and customers are constantly trading these things has no impact on the market, since a double-spend is impossible and we can determine exactly the conditions that trigger the payouts. Investors may have to put up large deposits to ensure payouts, or they can securitize their holdings with tokens that represent real assets. None of this is particularly different from the way things are done today, but insure-bits moves everything to a real-time basis, which will automate and improve the industry significantly.
This could happen in many other industries. Stop making custom products. Just make a number of identical products, turn them into smart tokens with all their rules attached, add the regulatory code, and let the market buy and trade them at will (think: mortgages, tax liens, bonds, etc.). Anything that is currently traded in large lumps could be traded as groups of tokens that represent the smallest unit of value in the lump. This increase in granularity requires less custom work, making markets more efficient.
I haven’t spent much time on it, but I think this general concept eliminates the need for most reinsurance as well. There will always be one-off cases for special insurance, but in general most of the basic insurance and re-insurance use cases can be met with combinations of standard insure-bits.
We’re Going to Need a Better Oracle
Which brings me to the oracle problem. People in the insurance business know that there is still no clean, decisive definition of a car accident. If smart contracts are going to pay off when triggered by various events and conditions in the real world, we’ll need oracle services to put that information onto the blockchain.
I won’t go into the details on oracles, because my friend Matt Liston has written a short piece on oracles that will get you started. Oracles will be hard to design, execute, and integrate with smart contracts, but they’ll be important. We’ll start with simple things and working toward more complex solutions. Insurance companies should be putting a lot of effort into oracle services — we’re going to need a lot of them, as each little atom of insurance will have its corresponding oracle to trigger payment unambiguously.
We’ll probably also need a better definition of time. If my car is in an accident, my personal data locker could immediately try to buy more insurance before the market is aware of the event. Cases like this will bring in a new, connected infrastructure that ties oracles, sensors, cameras, published information, witnesses, and the Internet of Things all together using a common timeline that helps determine what happens when. This is another set of challenges we’ll need to solve before the insure-bit ecosystem is fully functional. But it sure beats the ecosystem we have today.
Who wins and who loses in this scenario? Both people buying insurance and those providing risk capital gain. The losers are the large, branded insurance companies that like to keep the print very small and the contracts very long. Yet, if you think about it, there are opportunities. We’ll use software to do our dynamic allocation, and that software will be tied into our personal data lockers. Do you see any business opportunities there? Could this be a chance for insurance companies to re-invent themselves on the side of the customer, rather than extracting rents as intermediaries?
Summary
Yes, there are a lot of moving parts to this approach, but it’s very doable. It’s probably 95 percent more efficient than today’s insurance market, and possibly several times better for everyone except the intermediaries. It applies to plenty of other industries as well. The concept of tiny insurance tokens explodes the industry, from monolithic paper contracts to agile smart contracts that are infinitely adjustable both to buyers and sellers. A crazy idea like this could upend the insurance sector sooner than the CEOs of many large insurance companies may think.

The new age of insurance marketing
Sharing a presentation I put together for a talk at Lloyd’s last week. For avid followers of the sector you are unlikely to find anything new, but hopefully a useful overview. Plus a few personal views on which distribution models might or might not work out.


Trump Meets With Health-Insurance Executives About Repealing Obamacare
On Monday, President Donald Trump met with health-insurance heads to discuss transitioning the nation away from the Affordable Care Act, Reuters reports.
Health-insurance companies are a major contributor to how well Obamacare functions. When major companies such as UnitedHealth and Aetna began pulling out of states’ individual marketplaces last year, it left some states with just one marketplace insurer. Experts worried that, as those companies faced no competition, they would raise their premiums and make insurance unaffordable. “We must work together to save Americans from Obamacare — you people know that and everyone knows that, at this point — to create more competition and to bring down the prices substantially,” Trump said during the meeting.
Although it remains unclear what exactly might replace the Affordable Care Act if it is repealed, Trump mentioned he wants to expand health-care savings accounts, offer “state flexibility,” and allow Americans to buy insurance across state lines.

Data Analytics in Insurance
I attended the IBM World of Watson event last October. It was a great occasion to learn about the latest developments in data analytics and cognitive computing, to discover the IBM solutions for Financial Services and to meet with representatives from the Banking & Insurance industries.
Before highlighting how data analytics can be leveraged in Insurance, I would like to share 3 general observations:
[1] There is no single definition of Cognitive Computing. People agree broadly on the concept, but have different perspectives depending on their background. My definition:
cognitive computing is about leveraging the power of data analytics to create natural human-machine interactions, to extract knowledge from data, and ultimately to improve business decisions.
I divide Cognitive Computing into 3 categories:
Information capture (vision recognition, speech to text, …)
Information processing (NLP, clustering)
Machine learning (deep learning, predictive analytics)
[2] “Algorithms” cover a wide range of techniques from simple statistical reasoning, to machine learning and artificial intelligence. So when people try to sell you their “big data”, “data analytics” or “artificial intelligence” solution, it is worth digging to understand what is behind the words.

[3] Augmentation was a key theme: “intelligent” robots won’t replace humans completely, they will AUGMENT humans. It is not just a buzz word but something real. For instance in 2016 the songwriter-producer Alex Da Kid composed his song “Easy” with the help of IBM Watson. Watson analyzed both the sounds and lyrics of all the billboard hits for the last decades and was able to identify patterns. Alex used this output to refine the analysis and select some of the song’s themes. The song was the result of interactions between the human and the machine.
Now back to Insurance. Data analytics can be leveraged at different steps of the Insurance value chain:
Marketing
The analysis of customer segmentation and behaviors (predicting the churn to increase retention, anticipation of life events, etc.)
Sales & Services
Personalized advice to customers (product recommendation, cross-selling)
Support of contact center agents
Risk scoring & underwriting
Dynamic modeling of risks (combination of connected sensors with advanced analytics)
Fraud pattern detection
Operations & Claim management
Cognitive Automation: cognitive computing coupled with robotics process automation

Insights on Insurance and AI
This is a short piece summarizing applications of AI in the insurance industry

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing every industry, and insurance will be affected as well. As already stated in previous posts, AI today is perceived in three different ways: it is something that might answer all your questions, with an increasing degree of accuracy (“the Oracle”); it could do anything it is commanded to do (“the Genie”), or it might act autonomously to pursue a certain long-term goal (“the Sovereign”). My personal definition is the following one:
An artificial intelligence is a system that can learn how to learn, or in other words a series of instructions (an algorithm) that allows computers to write their own algorithms without being explicitly programmed for.
An artificial engine can also be classified in three ways: a narrow AI, which is nothing more than a specific domain application or task that gets better by ingesting further data and “learns” how to reduce the output error. An example here is DeepBlue for the chess game, but more generally this group includes all the functional technologies that serve a specific purpose. These systems are usually quite controllable because limited to specific tasks.
When a program is instead not programmed for completing a specific task, but it could eventually learn from an application and apply the same bucket of knowledge to different environments, we face an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This is not technology-as-a-service as in the narrow case, but rather technology-as-a-product. The best example for this subgroup is Google DeepMind, although it is not a real AGI in all respects.
The final stage is instead called Superintelligent AI (ASI): this intelligence exceeds largely the human one, and it is able of scientific and creative thinking; it is characterized by general common wisdom; it has social skills and maybe an emotional intelligence.
Regardless of the current stage of AI development, the insurance industry will be disrupted from several perspectives: first of all, every process that is done manually today will be automatized in a smart way (e.g., claims processing and management) to reduce costs and improve the UX. This would turn into a better fraud detection as well as more efficient loss prevention. The second block is obviously telematics and Internet of Things applications because innovative devices collect new data that can widen the horizon of insurable risks as well as refine the customized pricing. More generally, underwritings and more granular pricing will be better defined using machine learning techniques that spot out unknown meaningful correlations. Finally, customer acquisition and experience in a sector which is historically reserved for human agents will become completely digital: chatbots, more effective customer classification and targeting, and personalized contents and policies are the main immediate benefits from investments in AI technologies.
Historically, insurance is sold, not bought. But AI is coming, and it will undermine this principle. Is the insurance industry ready for such a change?

What Cyber Security taught me about Life Insurance

I have been enamored with both insurance and cyber security startups as an investor over the past 2 years but have always assumed that these were two separate interests of mine that managed to find a random meeting point in my life. I have been extremely fortunate to be an investor in Cirrosecure (acquired by Palo Alto Networks), Prevoty and InAuth, three thriving startups which I believe will form the pillars of cyber security in the future. In late 2014, I went on a hunt to find a startup that was keen on disrupting the online insurance market and thanks to my good friend Roseanne Wincek, I came to know two eager and highly talented founders, Jennifer Fitzgerald and Francois de Lame who were trying to disrupt the online insurance distribution model through their platform called PolicyGenius (you should Google the original name they came up with). After a year together, 4 board meetings and an additional $20M in the bank, I am blessed to have the both of them as friends and chalked it up to another fortunate chapter in my book of life.
So it was with interest that I read the TechCrunch article on Cockroaches vs Unicorns: The Golden Age of Cybersecurity startup as part of our daily reading as a team. Interesting data — expected that. But insightful? Didn’t see that one coming. Yes, the article was supposed to discuss the future of the cybersecurity ecosystem, but what stood out were the parallels they drew between cyber security and life insurance. The two disparate interests I had were not so anymore. While insurance and cyber security are two very different industries, the purpose they serve, value to the customer, the way they should be sold and what makes them so compelling as investments are strikingly similar. That “Aha” moment made me realize how I should be helping my other portfolio companies and improve my judgment as an investor
1. Consumer education needs to be data-driven but stay away from threats
I find it hard to do business with people who sell based on fear, “What will happen to your kids when you pass away?” or “Think of how much money you could lose if your servers went down for a day”. I am not asking you to downplay the risk factors but make your argument using actual data, probabilities and honest counsel. 83% of Americans don’t buy life insurance as they believe it is too expensive. $400 is what most Americans believe a 20-year, $250,000 level term life policy for a healthy 30-year-old costs annually. It actually costs $150 and more than half of that 83% would consider it to be affordable. Would that change your opinion on getting a life policy?
2. Choices are a good thing, but today’s consumer is overwhelmed with choices and desperately needs guidance
There are 18 million ‘stuck shoppers’ in the US who want life insurance but have been derailed in the shopping process largely due to the overwhelming number of options. The most common words you would hear if you attend a meeting with Chief Security Officers (CSO) is cyber threats and they want to know how to deal with it. Like life insurance shoppers, they are being approached by different software vendors who all sell the promise of helping them cast away all their worries. The 3 cyber security startups I invested in are all building a product in response to a specific, yet sizeable threat and have made that crystal clear in their messaging. Take Prevoty for example, organizations these days run multiple applications and the number will continue to grow. Instead of having a one size fits all security solution, organizations now need tailored security platform for each of their applications. Guiding the CSO to understand the problem, its magnitude and how your platform will fix that is what Prevoty does well.
3. “You can check-out any time you like, but you can never leave! “
Hotel California is one of my favorite songs of all time. I remember trying to learn the riff on the guitar back in high school, but could never quite master it. Perhaps not being able to leave might be too harsh a way to describe insurance and cyber security startups, but in a way it is true. Technological changes notwithstanding, insurance and cyber security is something that individuals and businesses will always need and will always pay for. The lifetime value of a customer is incredibly long and it makes no sense for customer who has been diligently paying their monthly payments to give up their insurance policy or security platform as if something goes wrong thereafter, then all the previous payments would have gone to waste. I challenge myself and entrepreneurs out there to create business models where the consumer is incented to continue with their monthly payments.
Ok, I shall end my post with a honest confession. I still have not bought a life insurance policy. I know, i know… and that is one of the first things on my ‘to-do’ list for 2016.

Should I Get Dental Insurance?
I probably should. But… ugh.
“Dental plan!” “Lisa needs braces!”
So the one thing holding me back for signing up for my new Bronze health plan is that the state of Washington is also now offering me the opportunity to sign up for a Bronze, Silver, or Gold dental plan.
This is new, or at least it’s new to me; previously I had been insured through Premera, but this year Premera told me that to get new Premera insurance I’d have to apply through Washington Health Plan Finder. I’ll tell you the story of that whole business later; it involved a lot of phone calls and glitchy websites, but I finally got my login set up, selected my Premera Bronze plan (with premiums that cost 19 percent more this year), and was given the option to add dental through SmartSmile.
The Bronze dental plan has a premium of $18.75 per month. There is no deductible, but there are no out-of-pocket maximums, either; it essentially gets you discounts on common dental procedures like cleanings and crowns, and anything not covered by the plan is my responsibility to pay in full.
Which, sure, I should get my teeth cleaned. It’s been a while. So I did the math: this dental plan will cost me $225 in premiums over the course of a year, plus another $71 for the checkup (including teeth cleaning, which comes with a separate subcharge, and X-rays).
I might be able to get a teeth cleaning for less than $296 without insurance. But I know that what I’m really paying for is the day when I break a tooth, or maybe have the first cavity I’ve ever had in my life, or something. None of that stuff has ever happened to me before—I did chip a tooth when I was a kid, but that’s it—but it could.
So. Should I get this dental insurance? Or should I continue not having dental insurance, just like I haven’t had dental insurance for the past four years?


Doh!
Why Health Insurance Companies Owe us Money
One of today’s headlines reads Blue Shield of California owes $83 million to Obamacare enrollees, small businesses. It’s easy to feel reactionary or angry upon learning this, of course. However, to understand how the money flows, let’s glance at a chronology of health insurance industry money.
Pricing. There are two basic types of health insurance pricing:
Community pricing & Actuarial pricing
Community pricing: economists look at a whole community to figure out what it costs to take care of that community. They then divide that total dollar amount by the number of people in the community. The resulting figure becomes the price per person for health insurance premiums.
Community pricing was the standard practice after World War II in the U.S. Back then the government left health insurance companies to run tax free; and it was a time when the average cost of insurance company administration was 5% leaving 95% of insurance premium dollars to be dispensed on health care. Back then premium prices were low — the sick and the healthy paid the same amount, but that didn’t bother anyone. Then, in the 1970s we saw an explosion of a) demographics and b) medical technology. People started living longer. Specifically, in the year 2000 as many people over the age of 100 were alive as were people over the age of 65 in 1965. The longer people live, the more likely they will need health care. But back in 1965, there were no CT scans or super expensive medications. So booming demographics and expensive technology, along with c) laws that demand that more and more health conditions must be covered by insurance, drove health insurance premium prices sky high.
Actuarial pricing: economists look at an individual person to determine the risk of getting sick to price insurance premiums. In this case, healthy people have low premiums and sick people have higher premiums.
Obamacare is a hybrid of community and actuarial pricing. The theory is that if enough young, healthy people buy health insurance they do not use, it will offset the costs of paying for chronically sick people. We don’t know yet if this “economics of balance” will work ……
But back to actuarial pricing -> insurance companies figured out how to weed out the sick people by denying care according to pre-existing conditions. Denial of care practices evolved 1975–1992 as health care costs began to explode. Large scale HMOs became the popular practice by the early 1990s when Wall Street entered health care to financialize it as they did so by focusing on management practices. During this evolution, management/administrative expenses crept up from 5% to 35% of health care operating budgets. One year the head of United Healthcare was paid a salary of $1.2 billion dollars! Finally, the government intervened by passing a law that the maximum amount of health care premium dollars allowed to be spent on administration was 20%. Since then, regardless of how health care is priced, we have the 80/20 rule mandating that 80% (and in some cases 85%) of premium dollars must be spent on providing care.
Gaming the System. It was not just health insurance exectives that practiced greed & cheat during this time. Providers (hopsitals, doctors) responded to the management of health care by gaming the system: for instance, hospital administrators would tell doctors to discharge patients as soon as possible, and often before they were ready. Because the less time a patient spent in the hospital, the more profit for that hospital. And if a patient needed a CT scan during their stay, for instance, doctors were ordered to discharge the patient and re-order the test as an outpatient procedure. While doctors may have felt uncomfortable, they did what they were told because 1) they were rated by hospital administrators and 2) they figured the patient who left too early would come back, allowing the hospital to collect money for two admissions instead of one. Another popular trick for gaming the system was via hospital codes and prices: wildly inflated hospital prices, that in many places are still prevalent today.
Government regulators have been working to stop the greed, for instance via Medicare and Medicaid audits like the RAC audit and ZPIC audit.
How Insurance Companies Make Money. There are two basic ways health insurance companies make money:
Premiums & Investments
When premium money comes into a health insurance company, it is referred to as a “loss” to set a mindset to avoid dispensing care. Health insurance companies try to minimize losses by setting up doctor panels and negotiating in-network contracts, for instance….practices that determine how much money a health insurance company pays providers for care (reimbursement). One such practice to determine health care reimbursement is called a Diagnosis Related Group (DRG). So let’s say it is determined that the cost of someone having a heart attack is $X. The health insurance company says to the hospital “We are going to pay you $X for a heart attack. Many heart attack patients who come in will experience complications that cost you more, and many other patients will experience easy recoveries that will cost you less, so it’s your job to decide how to manage the patients and practice medicine so you don’t go broke.” For this reason, doctors have been pressured to practice the cheapest medicine possible to maximize hospital profits by seeing as many patients per day as possible — a practice called fee-for-service. But Obamacare is forcing providers and insurance companies like Blue Cross away from fee-for-service health care. And Aetna published information on health insurance premium rates to inform customers how they are using their money.
Again, 80% of the money within a health insurance company must be spent on care. If there is ever any money left over from that 80%, health insurance companies must give back to customers via premium rebate checks.
In terms of investments, many health insurance companies are putting their money into digital health. Whether or not these investments will be profitable is yet to be determined.
Moving Forward with Obamacare.
Until Obamacare, individuals could only qualify for health insurance through employer work benefits, Medicaid (if financially qualified), or Medicare (if over the age of 65). This left millions of Americans without health insurance, creating a chaotic and uncontrollable economic landscape. Obamacare is rapidly spiking the number of people with health insurance, hypothetically balancing the economics. We don’t know yet. Like one insurance adjuster said to me “Pricing Obamacare health care plans is a bit like throwing darts: we don’t know yet how to make a profit until the many unknown accounting variables (are the newly insured paying their monthly premiums, how many are using state exchange plans vs. Medicaid, how many providers are accepting Obamacare contracts, etc.) settle in.” My guess for the end of year 1 was that insurance companies will come out to say they need to elevate premiums, while consumers and larger companies will demand more affordable health care.
Let’s see…….

Some GOP lawmakers back away from Trumpcare after learning millions will lose insurance
Not all Republicans are eager to back a plan that could cost 24 million people their health insurance.

On Monday, the Congressional Budget Office released its analysis of House Republicans’ plan to replace the Affordable Care Act with a series of smaller tax incentives for consumers and a massive tax cut for health insurance companies with overpaid CEOs. And its assessment that the legislation would result in 24 million more uninsured Americans over ten years has some congressional Republicans worried.
Trumpcare could cost 24 million people their insurance, government analysis finds
The Congressional Budget Office just released its much anticipated report. Republicans were right to be scared.thinkprogress.org
To push back on the CBO’s findings, Trump administration and Republican leaders have alternately attempted to cherry-pick favorable pieces of the scoring and to undermine the credibility of the non-partisan budget office (which is run by an economist who was handpicked by the congressional GOP leadership in 2015).
But a growing number of Republican legislators are indicating that the CBO scoring has given them pause or led them to oppose Trumpcare outright.
Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO): Blunt cheered the money-saving numbers in the CBO score, but conceded reservations about the report as a whole. “In terms of coverage, we need to get a better sense of what Health and Human Services can do,” he observed, adding that the 24 million number was “troublesome” to efforts to pass the bill.
Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA): A physician himself, Cassidy told Politico, “Can’t sugarcoat it. Doesn’t look good,” adding, “The CBO score was, shall we say, an eye-popper.” He told TPM the score was “awful.” “President Trump says he wants as many people covered as under Obamacare, and in that Washington Post article he said health care should be affordable. So if there’s truly 24 million people [losing coverage], of course it’s a concern.”
Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME): Collins said on Monday: “The CBO estimate that millions of Americans could lose their health insurance coverage if the House bill were to become law is cause for alarm. It should prompt the House to slow down and reconsider certain provisions of the bill.”
Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR): In a radio interview on Tuesday, Cotton opined that while the CBO “is not Moses,” he believes the House should have waited for the scoring before taking up the Trumpcare legislation. “It has a lot of useful information for us to digest,” he said. “I think it’s incumbent upon us to evaluate their evidence and facts [to] help improve the bill.”
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX):According to an ABC News reporter, Cruz said Tuesday that the scoring showed that “under the House bill, premiums would continue to rise next year and the year thereafter. That is unacceptable.”
Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT): In a statement in response to the CBO report, Daines said, “We need to do better… I want to see costs and premiums go down to make health care more affordable for Montana families.”
Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO): According to Politico, Gardner — who has expressed concerns about the Medicaid rollback provisions in Trumpcare — said, “We’ve got work to do here” in response to the CBO score.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC): Graham told reporters on Monday, “At the end of the day we should pause and try to improve the product in the light of the CBO analysis rather than just rejecting it.” He defended the nonpartisan effort, observing, “We like the CBO when they agree with us. When they don’t, they’re a bunch of losers… If half of what they’re saying is true, then I think we should slow down and see if we address it.”
Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT): In response to questions about the increase in uninsured estimated by the CBO, the Senate Finance Chairman said, “Naturally, I’m concerned.”
Sen. John McCain (R-AZ): TPM reported on Monday that McCain said that while the CBO was “wildly wrong on the initial estimates of Obamacare,” he also conceded, “I’m very worried about what the House bill would do to Arizona.”
Sen. David Perdue (R-GA): According to the Washington Post, after the CBO report, Perdue told reporters, “I’m not going to tell the House what to do, but it’s important that we slow this down and get this right.”
Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV): In response to the CBO scoring, Amodei told the Associated Press that he was disappointed in the GOP leadership for not getting more testimony before writing the bill and that if he had to vote today, he would likely vote no. He observed, “Quite frankly it looks right now that Nancy Pelosi was much more efficient.”
Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL): DeSantis told Fox Business on Tuesday that the “damaging part of that CBO report was they predicted — and I don’t know if this is true but I think there’s an argument that it is — 15 to 20 percent premium increases over the next several years over and above the Obamacare increases. Well, if that happens, then I think it’s gonna be even more difficult for people.”
Rep. Mark Walker (R-NC): The chairman of the 170-plus member Republican Study Committee put out a statement noting that the CBO score “does little to alleviate our conservative concerns for this Obamacare replacement bill.”
Rep. Rob Wittman (R-VA): Wittman announced his opposition to the Trumpcare legislation on Monday. “After reviewing this legislation and receiving the Congressional Budget Office score today, it is clear that this bill is not consistent with the repeal and replace principles for which I stand,” he explained, adding that as he does not think the proposal will do “what is necessary for the short and long-term best interests of Virginians.”
This post will be updated as more members make statements.

What It’s Like To See A Dentist With No Insurance
And, gulp, after 3 years
New Yorker cartoon by Sidney Harris available at All Posters
You all were very encouraging when I mentioned in a D1T some weeks ago that I had been neglecting my teeth for years since, like millions of Americans, I have no dental insurance. And you had good ideas for how to get a check up and cleaning without breaking the bank.
Time To Do 1 Thing! Like Maybe Call The Dentist
35% of Americans don’t have dental insurance. I’m one of them.medium.com
Local friend and Billfold pal Rachel Sugar got in touch with me to recommend someone in the area who was both affordable and good. I finally made the appointment, and I finally dragged myself to the office yesterday, and guys, I was so scared. Like “what if Trump gets his hands on the launch codes” scared.
Because what if the hygienist peeked in my mouth and then recoiled in horror? What if she dashed to a back room shouting, “Johnson! McNamara! Come quick, you have to see this”? What if she summoned the dentist and told him, “Hey, Dr. Rosencrantz, guess what: you can tell your wife that the two of you can totally afford that Bahamas vacation after all, thanks to this lady here in the chair and all the work she needs done on her teeth”?
Something like that actually happened to me when I saw a dentist for the first time in New York City, once I had finally gotten dental insurance through a job. The dentist told me I had several cavities. SEVERAL. And the hygienist made a face at me and said, “What kind of toothbrush do you use?” I was tempted to drown my embarrassment in the East River.
Luckily, this time, there was no drama. Everyone was super nice. No one shamed me for not having insurance or for avoiding fluoride-scented spaces for so long. No one shamed me at all! In fact, they did exactly what they advertised they would — check up, cleaning—and they treated me like a human being the whole time rather than a frackable plot of land from which they intended to extract all valuable resources before leaving it gaping and ruined.
Best of all, the dentist told me I had no cavities or problems that required follow ups. He gave me a goody bag and smiled me into the lobby, where I paid the lady at the desk and made another appointment for six months from now. Actual cost: $170. Abstract cost of putting the fear behind me and having healthier teeth: priceless.
Of course, in six months, they intimated, they’ll want to take some x-rays. I don’t even want to consider what x-rays would cost sans insurance, but hey, that’s the future! Who has the headspace to worry about that? Maybe by September I’ll have insurance again, or else I’ll have struck it rich by investing in fracking.

Kevin. Chatbot Insurance for the Sharing Economy
Today we are introducing Kevinsured.com. Kevin is a chatbot that provides micro-insurance for your P2P transactions with strangers. From buying football tickets to renting your bicycle, Kevin insures any P2P transactions against theft, fraud, scams, etc. Anything. With Kevin we don't care about the what. We care about the who.
It's really crazy, and that's why it's super exciting. Kevin could change the way we transact with one another.
A light-hearted comedy of a complex P2P transaction
Why we built Kevin:
We first started Traity because we thought that trust online was a problem. In 2011 I bought a second hand laptop on Gumtree. I made a transfer, but never received the laptop. The guy simply disappeared with my money. Maybe I was stupid, or maybe he was just an isolated asshole. Point is, I was scammed. And we didn't want that to happen to other people. Kevin is an iteration on Traity, which includes the real monetary value of insurance beyond our reputation technology.
Millions of transactions happen between strangers every day. Most of them work out really well, but the small percentage of scams make people fear strangers. Kevin will bring confidence to people buying, selling and renting from one another, to "insure the internet".
Kevin is detached from the marketplace. Basically, we don't care where buyers and sellers have met. On a marketplace like AirBnB or Uber, you get both the matching and the insurance in the same pack. But on listings like Craigslist, Gumtree and others, there is no insurance. We thought we could unbundle them, and just focus on the insurance part. So we don't have a search engine for things, we are not a marketplace. You find your buyer or seller somewhere else where there is no insurance, and Kevin insures the transaction.
How it works:
Chat with Kevin on Kevinsured.com and he will ask you what your P2P transaction is about. For example, you are buying train tickets from a stranger you met on Craigslist. Explain the transaction and Kevin will send you a unique link. Send this link to your counterpart, and once that person gets approved, your P2P transaction is insured, for up to $100 against fraud, theft, scams, etc. absolutely for free.
$100 may not sound like much, but it covers most of the transactions online. Furthermore, we think that this is not just about insurance but about prevention. Users who buy and sell through Kevin will be subject to reputation, and scammers will simply try to avoid it, so we are likely to see a low level of scams, just because scammers tend to prefer to be anonymous.
Insured over Blockchain :
Techies might want to know how it works internally. The Kevin protocol takes the reputation of both users, and if both are good, it creates a transaction on blockchain to timestamp that they have agreed to such transaction. This triggers 3 things:
Timestamps the transaction
Buys bitcoin to cover the liabilities in our Blockchain Balance Sheet (click for longer post)
Timestamps the reputation review
This is how the receipt looks like upon approval of the transaction. Both are covered for up to $100
If things go well, both gain 5 star reputation. If there was some scam, users can make a claim to Kevin. So we create a reputation and insurance system for all those marketplaces without star ratings, like craigslist, gumtree, etc.
The future of Kevin:
In the future Kevin could go freemium. For example, if you want to insure the purchase of a $1300 guitar, maybe we will charge $5 for the insurance.
The KevinAPI will also be made available for P2P marketplaces to get insurance for their products and services. In the end, Kevin is more a Protocol than a Bot. The chatbot (currently FB Messenger) approach is just a very simple way to get there.
The future of Insurance:
Insurance is a business where you only communicate with your provider twice. When you buy, which forces you to pay with no immediate benefit, and the moment you claim, which is an unhappy moment regardless. Kevin is more of a companion. Some people will use it for all their transactions, maybe once a month, or once a week. So it opens a completely different story about how to engage with an "insurance service", a companion who helps you along the way. This is a small concept today, but it can lead to big things in the future.
I very much appreciate any feedback and suggestions to make Kevin better, so please let me (or him) know, and we will listen and improve :)

Creating a Better Experience for Insurance
How insurance companies can create solutions to build engagement and long-term customer loyalty?

Insurance is a strange business. Clients are buying insurance in case of something they wish will never happen. Or as a form of a long term investment. Or because they are obliged by the law to have it. Either way there’s a feeling of paying for something and receiving nothing tangible in return. There are no frequent, positive, enjoyable or meaningful interactions between insurance companies and their clients. And when there is an interaction it is often in a sad circumstances of an accident or illness.
Digital initiatives by insurance companies are mostly concerned with selling and claims, and not much in between. But we think there are many possibilities for Value Added Services in insurance to make insurance companies a more helpful presence in their clients’ everyday lives. It’s a way to build a deeper connection with a brand. Otherwise insurers are in a trap of competing on price only, and maybe on quality of their services — but most opinions found online will be bad, because unhappy customers are the most likely to share their views.
Here’s a few ideas.
Connected Car and Helping Drivers
In 2013 we came up with an idea for a device that can connect virtually any car to the Internet. Our earliest concept was that this device, connected to a cloud, could predict a case of a breakdown of a car, then contact the driver and send a repair vehicle perfectly adapted to remove the discovered failure. We presented this concept to a largest insurance company in Poland — PZU, they became interested, and PZU Drive was born.

It was quite an innovative idea back then. In fact, PZU Drive was nominated for Cannes Lions Innovation Awards in 2013.
We have prototyped this device and tested it in the cars of the PZU employees.
Our early prototype of PZU Drive device
Since then we went through many iterations, many different concepts, and researches with customers, and we have learned a lot.
Design of PZU Drive device
Today pay as you drive or usage-based insurance is not uncommon, however services like PZU Drive can also work without being tied to an insurance product (or if it is just an option).
For insurance companies a wireless device plugged into a car can be a source of valuable data, and accompanying mobile app presenting data to the drivers can be a new channel of frequent communication with customers. The device can be offered for free with a car insurance and as a standalone paid product for clients of other insurers.
There is a lot of benefits a service like that can bring to the users:
The app can be a virtual coach teaching users how to drive better, offering feedback about their driving style and presenting helpful tips. There are many possible dimensions to measure, like safety, eco-driving, or taking care of the vehicle.
It can show users how much money they can save by improving their driving style (by using less fuel or less wear-and-tear issues).
It can present interesting statistics about users’ performance and vehicle usage in comparison to other drivers. This experience can be gamified — users can see their improvement in time and compete with their friends. And of course insurers can give rewards to the best drivers, and introduce new competitions and activations from time to time.
The app can present diagnostics information about the car and call assistance in case of a breakdown.
It can help users guard their parked cars. The device can periodically check and share location of the vehicle to the app, so the user can monitor that his vehicle is OK. The app can inform the user that her parked car has been bumped by some other car, or stolen. And it can help to locate the vehicle if the user forgot where he parked it.
And many more…
It is worth to notice that many useful features are possible only with GPS-tracking, but we found out that a lot of customers are concerned about their privacy and don’t want to have their location tracked continuously.
Preventive Health Services and Quantified Self
Some drivers may want to put some additional sensors in their cars, but many people already wear sensors on their bodies to monitor their health and physical activity — fitness bands, smartwatches, or just mobile phones.
The fact that no global insurance company had created a service competitive to Endomondo, Nike+, FitBit, or Strava, says a lot about industry’s digital maturity. Healthy customers are the best customers for insurance companies and having a channel of frequent communications with health-conscious people, and actual data about their physical activity, would be extremely valuable for insurers.
What if your insurance company gave you a fitness band (in their brand colors) as a physical gadget added as a bonus to your life insurance policy? Something to remind you everyday that your insurance company cares about your health and you should too.
It can be something like Xiaomi MiBand 2 fitness band, which retail price is only $20, and it can monitor activity, heart rate, and sleep.
Xiaomi MiBand
But more important than a band is a mobile app to accompany it. Most popular fitness apps are targeted at semi-professional athletes or users aspiring to become one. With their wellness apps insurers can target more casual users and even users who are seldom doing sports.
The app can monitor steps, exercise and stand-up time, sleep, weight (via HealthKit or Google Fit), and many others parameters. It can even measure work-life balance with the use of geofencing (how much time user is spending at the office and elsewhere). It can present environmental data like air pollution and allergy forecasts. It can motivate users to be more active and reinforce healthy habits. It can reward users for activity and inform them about their progress.
With an app like that the insurer have an opportunity to throw in little bits of educational content about insurance from time to time, to upsell new products to existing clients, and try to gain interest of prospects.
Many insurance companies are also offering medical services, which bring another angle to our app — for example automatic notifications about 
routine recommended medical examinations based on user’s sex and age.
Assistance in Everyday Life
Another way for insurance companies to be more frequently present in their clients’ lives is through Assistance.
Customers call their Assistance maybe once a year, and 2/3 of Assistance holders never do it. People are often simply not sure what they can demand from their Assistance. In Poland less than half of Assistance holders declare that they’ve read General Terms and Conditions of Insurance and 25% declare that they never read it (according to “VIIth Polish Nationwide Assistance Research”).
Now let’s imagine a mobile Assistance app that is designed like a restaurant menu — with a clear list of all the available services. Tap on the icon for a service to read more about it, and you can order it straight away. The app will locate you and call for help.
Services can be (mostly) free for the Assistance card holders, and paid for other users. If you’re not a client you can pay for a one-time service or become a client by buying a one-year Assistance card and have a service for free. In any case the insurer is a guarantee of quality.
Our concept of an Assistance mobile app
According to the previously mentioned survey, while the Roadside Assistance is still the most popular (85%), a lot of people find other types of Assistance useful:
Medical Assistance — 63%
Travel Assistance — 55%
Home Assistance (help of a plumber, locksmith, electrician, etc.) — 24%
And this can be a good opportunity for insurance companies— why not become “an Uber of Assistance”? ;)
There are just a few ideas from our experience of working with many insurance companies (Smart Home — in example — is one of the obvious areas to target next). What is important is that all of those concepts need some time to develop. Managers at insurance companies need to take a break from their short-term targets to pursuit some longer-term goals, if any serious innovation at this space can happen.

Nightmares that are much scarier now that you don’t have health insurance
he’s all you can afford now
Your teeth start falling out — It’s $50 just to have the dentist look at your teeth. Can you imagine how expensive dentures are going to be?
You show up to work naked — Best case scenario, you catch pneumonia and survive only to find out that you’ve been “fired” from your unpaid internship
There’s a menacing presence in the room and you can’t move — As long as the reason you can’t move isn’t that you’ve slipped a disc or something, menace away!
You scream but no sound comes out — Tonsillitis. My advice? Skip the ice cream after the operation and save a few bucks.
You’re flying over the city and begin to fall — You’re a bird with Avian Flu. Unless a gentle child nurses you back to health pro bono, you’re doomed.
Your therapist, with whom you’ve established a level of understanding that takes years of painfully revisiting your past, is suddenly out of network — Recurring.

The Possibility Effect: why lotteries and insurance exist

I recently finished reading Thinking Fast and Slow, a book on behavioral psychology and decision-making by Daniel Kahneman. One of the sections in Kahneman’s book is about choices — how people make decisions when faced with risk.
Many of us are familiar with the concept of loss aversion. When people are faced with an uncertain, risky outcome, then “losses loom larger than gains.” As Kahneman points out:
“In mixed gambles, where both a gain and loss are possible, loss aversion causes extremely risk-averse choices.”
As he continued to research loss aversion, Kahneman discovered a number of additional key insights. His insights were that (1) the prospect of losing a potential gain creates feelings of loss aversion, and (2) people may actually seek risks when facing near-certain losses. In other words, whether you are facing a gain or loss, and whether you think it’s high- or low-probability, influences your behavior.
Kahneman captures these insights in a concept called the Fourfold Pattern, which goes beyond loss aversion to show the different ways people respond to high- and low-probability events when they are either gains or losses.
This matrix (and all below) excerpted from Thinking Fast, and Slow by Daniel Kahneman
In this 2x2 matrix, the top row contains scenarios that are likely to happen (high probability), either gains or losses. These scenarios correspond to the “Certainty Effect.” The bottom row contains scenarios that are unlikely to happen (low probability), either gains or losses. These scenarios correspond to the “Possibility Effect.”
Within each cell of the matrix, you have the following:
an outcome (e.g. “95% chance to win $10k”)
an emotion that is evoked (e.g. “Fear of disappointment”)
the typical behavior (e.g. “RISK AVERSE”)
Let’s look at each cell in some detail:
High probability gain (“settle out of court”)

This is the situation that is captured in the top left cell of the matrix.
In this scenario, you face a likely gain. You have a 95% chance of gaining $10k. If someone offered you $9k with 100% probability, would you take it? If you’re a student of economics, you would say, “The expected value of my current situation is $9.5k = 95% & $10k. So why should I take $9k with 100% probability? It’s less than the $9.5k expected value.”
But many people would indeed take the $9k with 100% probability offer. Why? They would do so because they feel risk averse in this scenario. Even though the probability is small (5%), the potential loss of the entire $10k looms large. They are motivated by a fear of disappointment: “What if I don’t gain the $10k that is right within my grasp?” So what do people in this scenario do?
Here’s a real-life situation. Imagine that you’re the plaintiff in a civil case, and you believe you have a 95% chance of winning the case and an award of $10k. The defendant knows that they are likely to lose the case, so they offer an out-of-court settlement of $9k. The plaintiff would most likely take the settlement, even though it’s below the expected value ($9.5k) and the full amount they are very likely to receive ($10k).
High probability loss (“all in”)

This is the situation that is captured in the top right of the 2x2 matrix.
You are faced with a near-certain loss — you have 95% chance to losing $10k. But you have some hope — though only a slim 5% chance — of avoiding the loss.
What do you do? Do you “know when to fold,” take your losses and move on? Or, do you go “all in” with whatever you have remaining, in the hopes that you may recover the near-certain loss?
Most people, surprisingly, go “all in.” Here is what Kahneman had to say about this scenario:
“Many unfortunate human situations unfold in the top right cell. This is where people who face very bad options take desperate gambles, accepting a high probability of making things worse in exchange for a small hope of avoiding a large loss. Risk taking of this kind often turns manageable failures into disasters. The thought of accepting the large sure loss is too painful, and the hope of complete relief too enticing, to make the sensible decision that it is time to cut one’s losses. This is where businesses that are losing ground to a superior technology waste their remaining assets in futile attempts to catch up. Because defeat is so difficult to accept, the losing side in wars often fights long past the point at which the victory of the other side is certain, and only a matter of time.”
The next two cells of the matrix illustrate the Possibility Effect — the behavior of individuals when they believe that there’s even a small possibility of a large gain, or a large loss.
Low probability gain (“the lottery”)

This is the scenario captured in the bottom left cell of the 2x2 matrix.
You are faced with an unlikely gain — there’s a small chance that you will gain a significant reward of $10k. Given this hope of a large gain, you become more risk seeking. As Kahneman writes:
“The possibility effect in the bottom left cell explains why lotteries are popular. When the top prize is very large, ticket buyers appear indifferent to the fact that their chance of winning is minuscule. A lottery ticket is the ultimate example of the possibility effect. Without a ticket you cannot win, with a ticket you have a chance, and whether the chance is tiny or merely small matters little. Of course, what people acquire with a ticket is more than a chance to win; it is the right to dream pleasantly of winning.”
Combined with the overconfidence and over-optimism biases, the possibility effect for gains explains why so many people become entrepreneurs or start small businesses. Although only 66% of businesses survive their first two years, and only 50% survive beyond the first five, small business owners become risk seekers because they are motivated by the hope of large gains.
Low probability loss (“insurance”)

This final scenario is captured in the bottom right cell of the 2x2 matrix.
You are faced with an unlikely loss — there’s a small chance that you will lose the large amount of $10k. Given this fear of a large loss, you become risk averse. This is a flavor of the loss aversion behavior that many of us are familiar with. As Kahneman writes:
“The bottom right cell is where insurance is bought. People are willing to pay much more for insurance than expected value — which is how insurance companies cover their costs and make their profits. Here again, people buy more than protection against an unlikely disaster; they eliminate a worry and purchase peace of mind.”
This is why insurance, extended warranties, and protection plans exist. Even though the chance of a loss is small, if it happens it will be painful. Hence you’re willing to pay a small insurance premium to eliminate or reduce the risk.
So what? Why is this all important?
In the business world, we are often making decisions ourselves, or persuading others to give their support for decisions. It’s important to understand some of the biases and heuristics that we have that will affect our decision-making — especially when it comes to risk and probabilities.
The next time you are making a decision or an argument to persuade others, think about the situation. Could the Possibility Effect influence the decision? How should you frame your argument?
If the situation you face is a low-probability loss, pitch your proposal as “peace of mind” insurance. Why not pay a small premium to reduce or eliminate the risk?
On the other hand, if you face low-probability gains, you might observe the group’s tendency to be risk-seeking. If you disagree with the risk-seeking approach, call out the “lottery effect” in the group’s thinking.
By taking a bit more time to analyze the situation, we can make a better decision or more successfully persuade those whose support we need. Keep in mind the possibility effect, the reason why lotteries and insurance exist.

Trump budget boss: If you want insurance to cover maternity care, lobby your state legislature
Trumpcare: Giving you the freedom to purchase health insurance that covers nothing.
CREDIT: CBS screengrab
On Thursday, President Trump and the House Freedom Caucus tentatively worked out a deal: Trump would agree to remove mandatory coverage of “essential services” from his health care bill in order to win the far-right caucus’ support for it.
Essential services include maternity and newborn care, pediatric care, emergency services, substance abuse treatment, and prescription drug coverage. Under the Affordable Care Act, every health insurance plan sold in the US must cover them.
House GOP leaders agree to gut essential health benefits, begin hemorrhaging moderate votes
A short-sighted attempt to appease conservatives could easily backfire.thinkprogress.org
But with no women present, the Trump administration and House Republicans decided on a plan that would allow insurers to sell health care policies without maternity care coverage in states that allow it.
Vice President Mike Pence tweeted out a photo from the room:

On Friday morning — hours ahead of the expected House vote on the bill — Budget Director Mick Mulvaney went on CBS This Morning to defend a bill he’s played a key role in crafting. While on the program, he offered some advice to people who require essential benefits but live in states that wouldn’t require them under the law: If you don’t like it, just move.
The New York Times reports that on Thursday, Mulvaney issued an ultimatum on Trump’s behalf to “recalcitrant” House Republicans asking them “to fall in line behind a broad health insurance overhaul” on Friday “or see their opportunity to repeal the Affordable Care Act vanish.”
On CBS, Mulvaney said that “we have made the bill much better over the course of the last weeks.”
“The point of the matter is this — they know they don’t like Obamacare, people back home know they don’t like it,” he continued. “It takes the control of their own health care out of their hands, it takes affordability away from them and they want something better. What’s sitting in the House today is better than that.”
In response, host Alex Wagner shot back, “Mr. Mulvaney, when you talk about something better, does that include the slashing of essential services, included maternity care, emergency services, and prescription drugs?”
Mulvaney responded by arguing that essential services coverage is really a states’ rights issue.
“States not only have the ability to require those services, many of them already do,” Mulvaney said. “I talked to some folks from the Northeast and it was like, ‘Yeah, we don’t really mind that much about essential health benefits because our states already require insurance policies sold in those states to have that.’ What we’re doing is taking away the federal control of these systems.”

Asked “what about a state that doesn’t do that,” Mulvaney advised, “Then you can figure out a way to change the state you live in.”

While the elimination of essential benefits makes Trumpcare more appealing for some Freedom Caucus members, House Republicans with different priorities argue it has made the bill worse.

And many medical professionals are appalled. Hal Lawrence, CEO of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told USA Today that eliminating essential benefits requirements was a “horrible idea.”
“It’s a horrible idea that takes away women’s access to preventive and maternity care,” he said. “What [members of Congress] will do is increase illness, pregnancy complications, cancer and death.”

How I Used Science to Fight Back and Win my Insurance Company.
This post is dedicated to new students starting their graduate school studies today. Basic science skills can also be quite useful in the ‘real world’.
My cellphone buzzed as I was about to leave my house for work. My wife was on the line, her voice shaking: “Yaniv, someone hit us”. She had just dropped off our son at daycare and picked up two daughters of a family friend on her way to school, where she taught. While she was waiting at the traffic light in the left lane, a large pick-up truck with a dolly came in the right lane and made an overly ambitious wide turn (see figure below). Luckily, neither she nor the kids were hurt. But the dolly scraped the right part of the car, all the way from the back wheel fender to the front passenger door of our 2003 Toyota Matrix. The pickup driver did not even bother to stop. He just continued quickly driving and my wife did the right thing by not chasing him with two kids in the back.
The rectangles represent the approximate positions of our car and the truck. The cars shown in the image are unrelated to the accident
I was not too worried: no casualties, which is the most important thing. The car also looked totally functional, including the two doors on the right side (see cover photo of this story). In fact, my wife could even drive the car to her school no problem. The only issues were the scratches and two dents that were just cosmetic. After she calmed down, I asked my wife to give our insurance company a call and report the accident. I thought we would end up paying the deductible and that the car would spend a few days in the garage, which is not a big deal since our policy covered reimbursement for car rental after an accident.
Part 1: Questioning authority
I was stunned when J., the adjuster told me that they are going to total the car. “You must be kidding me”, I said in disbelief over the phone, “This car can drive. It only needs some body work”. He calmly replied that the cost of repairing the car is very similar to the amount they would return if they total the car and there is nothing he can do about it. The car must be totaled. “How much are you going to give me?,” I asked with concern. At that point, he provided a long list of numbers and the method they used to calculate the value of the car. I have to admit that it sounded impressive — a solid system to precisely measure the value of the car. The result was much less impressive to me: ~$2800.
It never occurred to me that insurance companies can profit from their clients’ losses.
What am I going to do with $2800? Buying a similar car was going to cost about 10 grand and I really did not need the ‘fun’ of car shopping. “Can you please undo everything?”, I asked him, “We just want to get our car back. Please cancel the claim and we will take the car to our own mechanic”. “I cannot do that”, he replied, “Once I totaled your car, you are technically driving a salvage”. I was about to declare a total defeat, but thought to give it one last chance. “Is there any way that I can keep the car even as a salvage?”, I asked. “Well, you are the first one to ask me that in 14 years”, he replied confused. “We can give you the car, but then we need to deduct the cost”. “How much is that?”, I asked impatiently. Checking on the computer for a few minutes, he replied “The value of the car as a salvage is around $3700, so basically you will get nothing”.
I could not believe his answer. In probability classes, we teach that insurance works because of the “central limit theorem”. When risk is pooled among many insured, the expected losses approach the actual losses, meaning that the premium is a fair measure of the expected loss plus some profit for the insurer that underwrites the risk. It never occurred to me that insurance companies can profit from their clients’ losses.
“This is ridiculous!” I cried. “You value my car higher as a salvage than a drivable vehicle. Of course you want to total it — you are going to make money this way! Does it sound reasonable that you will profit from my accident?” There was a long silence on the other side of the line. “Let me check what I can do, Mr. Erlich”, he answered.
That evening, I found that J. salvage value was wrong. Checking a few salvage purchasing websites showed that at best my salvaged car would be worth a bit over $1000. How can I trust this person?
A few days later, J. sent me an email that contained a 19-page report about the appraisal of my car. This report also looked super-impressive. It had numbers, charts, and references on how exactly the value of my car was calculated. But at that point, I already developed mental antibodies to this quantitative analysis theater. If they can claim that the value of my car as a salvage is higher than an operating vehicle, anything is possible.

There was also the first sign that being stubborn pays — they increased the return to $3312. On the phone, J. said that he was playing nice with me and decided to not include a few scratches that existed prior to the accident. I thought to myself: Wow! Fifteen minutes on the phone can really save you 15% or more. Just not the fifteen minutes that you think.
Part 2: Address confounders
Feeling motivated by this quick victory, it was tempting to keep poking holes in their analysis. The costs of the prior damages were too complicated and they already gave me something there. Instead, I thought to focus on the Base Vehicle Value that describes the Fair Market Value of similar cars without any prior damage.
Examples of ad entries from the report
The report included a list of 23 car advertisements of similar models that used to appraise my car. In addition to the ad price, it also reported the distance of the seller from my house. My insurance company simply averaged all ads to estimate the value of the car. However, I found it a bit odd that some of the ads were for cars in Connecticut, over 80 miles from my house in Cambridge, in towns whose poverty rates are doubled compared to the Boston metropolitan. You do not need to have a Nobel Prize in Economics to suspect that the same model is sold a bit cheaper in places where income is lower.
“Don’t mess with me. I am a nerd. I actually enjoy doing this and have all the time in the world to keep at it”
Twenty minutes later, I created a graph that presented the price as a function of the distance of the ad from my house. Using linear regression to remove the effect of distance, the graph showed that my car should be worth about $200 more than the value they estimated. In fact, for every mile away from Cambridge, the ads were on average $4 lower. That does not sound like “Fair Market Value” to me.

At that point, J. handed me over to his supervisor, F. I emailed F. the graph and explained the matter over the phone. My line was that as a scientist, I need to reveal the true Fair Market Value of the car before we can proceed forward. The subtext was “Don’t mess with me. I am a nerd. I actually enjoy doing this and have all the time in the world to keep at it”.
A day later, F. sent an updated report. He filtered all of the long distance ads, which raised my return to $3495.

Part 3: Always ask for the raw data
So far, I got six hundred dollars over the initial offer for a net of 2–3 hours of my time. Not so bad, if you consider that this money is not taxable. The Fair Market Value suddenly looked much more vulnerable to the rigors of analysis, so I decided to keep hammering at it. The new report by the insurance company listed now only five ads that were used to estimate the value of my car.
I love raw data. There are too many examples in the recent history of genomics where the raw data and the presented story in a manuscript did not agree. So I decided to call to one of the sellers of the ads. The car was very similar to mine and the report claimed that it would cost $6,979 to buy the car.

Surprise. Surprise. The sale representative told me that this car was just sold for $7,887, almost a thousand dollars above what the report claimed. I took the name of the sales representative just in case.
I sent the data to F. who immediately replied that an external company makes the reports for them and I should speak with them.
I called the external company, but I wanted to record the conversation in order to use it as evidence if needed. Massachusetts is part of the eleven states that require a two-party consent to record phone conversations. No problem — I started the conversation by asking the representative if I can record our phone call. She agreed without hesitation. After presenting the situation, I asked her why there is a discrepancy between the ad and the actual price. Her reply was stunning:
“[T]hat happens quite often. They will list it lower online because it is their Internet sales pricing, which is cheaper than what you are going to find on a window sticker or on the vehicle on the lot”.
Bingo! She just admitted on record that their online ad scanning system is likely to be downward biased compared to the actual selling prices of the cars. I called F. again and played the phone conversation with the report company to him. Again, there was a long silence on the other side of the phone. Then, he told me to wait a few days until he can speak with his bosses.
Four days later, he sent me an email. No more long reports with fancy charts and numbers. He probably realized that this will just make the situation worse. His “final offer” was described in just one sentence and amounted $4561.78.

Accepted!
Epilogue
By exercising grad school skills — questioning the authority of the adjusters, removing confounders from the analysis, and looking at the raw data — I was able to win my insurance company. Their tactics are well-known in science: they cherry picked their data (ads, distance); they tried to overwhelm me with information to make their case; and they insisted on communicating nonsensical results (salvage value that is higher than an operable vehicle value). These are the tricks that bad scientists use. Nothing new — just a different domain.
After I texted the new offer to my wife, her reply had one word: “genius”. I have a PhD, some nice publications, and won a few awards in my life, but she has never called me a genius before. I guess this is the difference between grad school and the real world.

Insurance, meet Reputation: Traity goes #insurtech
For the last few years, Traity has been committed to building trust between strangers. We created the Traity Score, the ReputationAPI, the HandShakeAPI and put your reputation on Blockchain, to help people prove and show their reputation in different contexts and marketplaces, helping them transact more safely.
During 2014 we had incredible user growth, and many sharing economy marketplaces integrated our ReputationAPI so that their users would not have to start from zero stars every time. Unfortunately we were unable sign-up partners like AirBnB or Uber. They consider the reputation of their users part of their competitive advantage, and we failed at finding enough value for our users to use their Traity profile in enough marketplaces.
We still believed that P2P transactions are fundamentally based on trust, and that the economic and social impact of lack of trust on society is vast. Mid 2015 we started to reconsider "What is Trust", "What is reputation", and "where do they really matter". There are two large industries that depend heavily on trust: Credit and Insurance.
Insurance, meet Reputation
As Terry Pratchett put it, "Insurance is betting that something bad will happen". Something is insurable when the willingness to pay is higher than the odds. The problem is that in some cases, the customer can interact with the odds, which is the reason why insurance companies don't trust their own customers.
There are some insurance services that cannot be easily influenced by the reputation of the customer, like Life Insurance or Health Insurance. Reputation cannot predict accidents or sudden illnesses (Fitbit is much more likely to work that out). However there are other insurance services where there is a high level of moral hazard in control of the user, who can significantly change the economics of the insurance product, and here is where reputation matters.
We decided to start with Income protection insurance. Landlord protection is a well known old product, but it's highly inefficient because the price of the insurance is largely related to the rent price of the home. However almost 100% of the risk lies with the tenant. Landlord-Tenant relationships are the largest P2P transactions we make every month, but we simply don't call them “Sharing economy”.
And yet the industry is incredibly opaque:
Tenants know very little about the landlord's previous behavior
and landlords know very little about the tenant's previous rents. 
 This lack of trust leads to large deposits and need for guarantors.
Fixing global challenges through Trust
The deposit is a form of insurance. It's just a very inefficient form of insurance. It's like saying that because you don't trust me, you will charge me $10,000 in advance, for all the things I could break, which is probably 3 or 4 sigmas above the average.
In a world where most people have less than $1,000 in savings, deposits of $5,000+ limit people's access to homes, segregation, and lack of opportunities to a better life in a more developed city or country, since people simply cannot move to those cities.
When I moved to the US, landlords asked me for a $14,000 deposit or a $40,000 bank guarantee because as an immigrant I did not have a credit score. It was clearly a problem of trust, solved very poorly.
Traity goes #insurtech:
Jordi Rivera, CEO of DAS Spain, came to our office to sign the contract :)
I am happy to announce our partnership with DAS, subsidiary of ERGO, part of the giant MunichRe group, and leader in legal protection insurance services, to provide landlord income protection insurance to people with non-traditional forms of employment, without credit scores, young, students, immigrants, or people who hate to pay high deposits to their landlords and would rather hold to their own cash, a.k.a. you.
The implications of this are vast and have important ramifications:
As an example, there are over 3 million empty houses in Spain. Often because landlords don't trust the tenants they might get. The reduced supply leads to less choice, higher prices, higher deposits and significant costs of opportunity to society.
We aim to reduce default rate by about 50% ceteris paribus on the current rental market by selecting great people and creating accountability and trust. By fixing this, many more homes will be on the market, eventually reducing prices.
Furthermore, by reducing the fear of landlords and covering the rent, we aim to reduce the need for deposits, which today lead to segregation and limits access to opportunities.
All of this based on our own reputation scores, on our patented technology of Networks of Trust, FB data, eBay stars, LI social network analysis, AirBnB semantic analysis, to create scores that are not just complementary but superior to traditional credit scores, as we measure behaviors, not static solvency.
This way we will help all those people who cannot easily prove their trustworthiness, maybe because they are immigrants, students, or work as freelancers on Uber and don't have a blue-chip pay-slip to show.
I believe that this is the first of many services we and the whole Fintech industry will be able to provide thanks to reputation. We look forward to delivering on our mission of helping people access all sorts of opportunities based on their trustworthiness.
Starting and Next steps.
Our partnership with DAS starts in Spain first through seguros.traity.com, but the intention is to expand to other economies soon. Once social scoring is validated as a risk evaluation tool, a deeper ReputationAPI integration will take place, so that DAS can better serve their own customers.
This partnership (and others in different countries that we will be announcing soon) is a stepping stone in our development as a company. It gives Traity the opportunity to prove that online reputation and social data extrapolates to our behaviors in "real life". Once this experiment works out, the impact to our society will be vast:
As a global example of what the future could look like for us, Indian landlords can require 7 to 9 months of deposit to new tenants. This limits the ability for rural indian young people to move to the city and find a job. In India over 200 million people have bank accounts, and yet 600m have FB accounts.
Closer to "home", over 40% of the population in the US is expected to go freelance by 2020 (Ask Arun Sundararajan). These people need new options to get access to financial and insurance services, and credit scores won't help them. But we will be there for them.
I often have a David/Goliath feeling to all this. As if we were too small to even dare to have such ambitions; and yet I am addicted to fighting Goliath, falling back to the ground, spitting some blood, and standing up again. Because one of these times, perhaps we will win.

Paytm Auto and Cab partners drive away worries with free health insurance

In India, auto rickshaws and cabs are the pillars that support the country’s last-mile transport. These good folks are always on the road, driving us places. However, due to the high-risk lifestyle, they are less likely to get insurance. We strongly felt this should change, and it did.
We have partnered with TATA AIG General Insurance to offer free cashless health insurance to auto and cab drivers across the country. The new insurance provides them a safety net against accidents and covers their existing health conditions. We think it’s the best way to say thank you for everything they continue to do for us.
The new insurance scheme covers hospitalization expenses. Paytm will pay the first 2 EMIs on behalf of the drivers, while subsequent EMIs can be paid by the drivers themselves using the Paytm App. This is available to auto and cab partners who accept payments with the Paytm Wallet.
We feel this will help thousands of drivers across the country.

Thesis: Cyber Insurance
The world is under attack from cybercriminals. A terrorist, an anarchist, a nation state, a thief and a disgruntled insider all have different motivations to infiltrate your business and expose the secrets, with vastly different financial consequences. Moreover, each company’s risk protection is also highly variable — owning the latest security products may be a false sense of comfort.
Measuring risk is what the trillion dollar global insurance market has become surgically good at, allowing them to effectively underwrite and re-insure complex policies against that risk posture. However, that level of precision is still a massive void when it comes to the world of cyber insurance. The world’s largest cyber insurers today have more questions than answers on how to make this process more efficient. We see opportunity to quantify the end-to-end risk and unify the user experience for cyber insurance products.

Insurance Tech Benefits Landlords and Tenants in our Backing of TheGuarantors

Insurance Tech as a sector has seen a surge in funding of 42% YoY in H1 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 with more than 80 deals topping $1B in funding. The market is however still young and we are seeing a lot of room for technological disruption. 62% of the deals in H1 2016 are at the Seed and Series A level, with 63% of the deals coming from the U.S. (source)
One of the subsectors of Insurance Tech that is least discussed but that represents a large market is insurance on rental payments. To avoid ambiguity, we are not talking about renters’ insurance; rather we are discussing insurance on the monthly payments of rent paid by the renter to the landlord. In terms of market sizing, it is estimated that $94B in rent is paid per year in New York City alone with a total of 2.2 million rentals in 2014 (~15% of U.S. apartment rental market), and another $518B rent across the rest of the country. In fact, the renter fraction in the US is 36.9%. The insurance opportunity is rooted in the default rate on these leases: 6% to 35% of these rental leases, depending on the tenants’ profiles, are defaulted.
We therefore see a massive opportunity for technology to help insure these rental leases and we are delighted to announce our investment in TheGuarantors, led by Julien Bonneville.
Evolving in an environment which is seeing a lot of potential growth, TheGuarantors’ solution meets the needs of landlords and building property managers, brokers and prospective tenants by offering renters to be their guarantor for a fee. The company helps landlords and renters to connect, and secure the rent payment over the duration of the lease.
Prospective tenants who most benefit from TheGuarantors include students, recent grads, internationals of all ages & wealth levels, retirees and self-employed individuals. These tenants have every intention to pay their rent every month but, after hunting and finally finding their dream apartment, they are told by the landlord that they need a guarantor to be approved for the apartment. TheGuarantors helps the tenant secure the apartment.
In fact, one the team members of White Star could have benefited from TheGuarantors when he moved to the United States several years ago. Because TheGuarantors did not exist and our team member was an international expat working for an international company, to secure the apartment he had to provide a corporate guarantee from his employer (a complicated task not available to most new renters in New York).

TheGuarantors is especially useful in cities where landlords want to avoid vacancies and where there are high income requirements for prospective tenants to rent apartments. Partners include StuyTown / Peter Cooper Villlage, Moinian Group, Gotham Organization, Silverstein Properties, Eastbridge Group and many others.
In addition to guaranteeing all rent payments at no cost to the landlord, its insurance policy coverage includes industry-firsts such as:
Legal fees up to the amount of security deposit
Holdovers covered up to two months’ rent
Landlords have access to a dedicated portal in which they manage online claims, track processes and see units covered.
We expect that TheGuarantors’ product will also disrupt the existing market for landlords and renters in other large cities such as Chicago, Washington DC, Boston, San Francisco and many international cities. In any city where prospective tenants need to demonstrate financial metrics to be approved for an apartment, TheGuarantors can make the lives easier for landlords, agents/brokers, and renters.
Julien and team are on a mission to transform the rental market and we are proud to be backing them!

What this denial of service leads to is exactly the kind of drug rationing that free market conservatives have been warning about for years, usually to vocal derision from the left. (Photo: iStock Photos)
How the Insurance Market Is Responding to Obamacare
by Gregg Keller
I split my time pretty evenly between Washington, D.C., and my hometown of St. Louis, Missouri. In D.C., if you want to get your fix of crony capitalism or government mandates, they’re only a step away at any time. But if you want to capture a perfect specimen of crony capitalism and government overreach in the wild, it’s a little more difficult out here in “Flyover Country.”
So you can imagine my fascination when an organization called the “Institute for Clinical and Economic Review” announced it was coming to town to give us just such a perfect example. Even the name is perfectly “Kafkaesque.”
In the wake of ridiculous Obamacare mandates, the insurance industry is under tremendous cost pressure to deny its customers access to expensive life-saving drugs. But those insurance companies don’t want to take the public relations hit for denial of these drugs that cost billions in research and development to get to market, hence the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review.
The institute helpfully steps into the breach and, with funding directly from the insurance industry and its allies, produces “research” that even liberals acknowledge vastly limits patients’ access to life-saving drugs.
Essentially, the insurance industry is passing on largely bogus research through a front group, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, that gives insurance companies leverage to deny coverage to expensive cures. It’s a perfect example of Washington, D.C.-style self-dealing and crony capitalism.
What this denial of service leads to is exactly the kind of drug rationing that free market conservatives have been warning about for years, usually to vocal derision from the left.
That’s not the only terrifying thing about the institute’s process, however. At the St. Louis event — which was held to determine if new drugs for a deadly blood cancer are worth their cost (despite their ability to extend life) — one of its paid staff helpfully told us that 70 percent of the organization’s funding came from nonprofits.
As if that kind of opacity is supposed to make us feel any better. Shoot, the Center for American Progress is a nonprofit too, but I wouldn’t let those guys change my tire, let alone decide what lifesaving drugs my child can access. That’s one thing you’ll find about the institute: A consistent lack of transparency. Despite its claims that it’s pristinely funded by nonprofits, if you dig deeper, you’ll find that the institute is actually mostly funded by the insurance industry.
But have no fear, we were told by the organization’s representatives in St. Louis! What could possibly go wrong with the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review’s procedures? Well, for starters, how about the fact that its processes have been likened to the British socialized health care system.
Sure to upset my fellow pro-lifers are the implications of quality-adjusted life years — the key to the institute’s methodology to determine the “value” of drugs. Quality-adjusted life years, which are used in Britain to ration drugs, expressly say that the sick and elderly’s lives are worth less than younger, healthier people’s lives.
Opponents will say that the institute’s reach only impacts the private market. And yet, there are troubling signs that its rationing will soon start to infect the public market as well.
And it’s likely that the institute is coming to a town near you. The group’s regional bodies will hold public meetings, like the one in St. Louis, across the country in the coming months, including Los Angeles this month and Portland, Maine, in July. That’s bad news for patients and good news for the insurance companies that benefit from the institute’s manipulation of the media. The institute has effectively sold the press that it’s a “trusted” and “independent” nonprofit.
Not so. Rather, it means price controls. Drug rationing. The tip of the death panel spear. Crony capitalism. Self-dealing. Lack of transparency. Links to European-style socialized medicine. Ties to the Obama administration. And a direct threat to our pro-life beliefs. There is truly something in the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review for every conservative to hate.

Insurance used to work like this. I don’t know enough about the market to know how it works today, and it has always irked me that I don’t get more of a benefit than I do for leading a healthy lifestyle.
For example, it used to be (don’t know about today because I signed up for insurance so long ago I’ve never been asked again) non-smokers got reduced premiums.
Risky behavior used to be penalized as well. In my 20s, I was actually denied insurance because I truthfully answered “yes” to the insurance form’s question, “Do you scuba dive.” Other risky activities they asked about included motorcycle riding and skydiving (neither of which I did, or at least not at the time).
Therefore, one can assume that the insurance companies had actuarial statistics on risky activities as well as smoking.
I coach cancer survivors in physical fitness. I am all for incentivising healthy lifestyle choices through insurance benefits. This is something that could be tweaked with the ACA. But that is not the same thing as denying someone benefits entirely because of who they are or how they live.
I have always been a physically-active, non-smoking, barely-drinking, safe-driving, low-blood-pressured, healthy-eating, actuarial-table-sweet-spot-weighted person. Yet I still got cancer. Life is not completely in our control.

Drone Map Saves Insurance Company €99,985,000
Dronotec uses DroneDeploy to provide vital information to insurance companies
By Anya Lamb, Marketing Manager @DroneDeploy
After a disaster, it’s important to clean up and rebuild, but it’s also critical to capture the site as it is so that the damage can be assessed. Drone mapping gives insurance companies a fast, easy way of accurately documenting the scene, preserving key details while letting the process of clean-up and reconstruction begin as quickly as possible.
Emilien Rose, Founder of Dronotec
This case study comes from Emilien Rose, founder of Dronotec, a start-up specializing in drone inspection for insurance companies. After working as a loss assessor in France and Australia over the last 10 years and assessing about 8,000 claims, Emilien started Dronotec in December 2014.
“I created Dronotec because I saw the potential for drones to address issues I encountered in my job as a loss assessor, such as assessing dangerous, large or inaccessible areas, while reducing the risk of accidents,” said Emilien. Since starting Dronotec, he’s discovered many ways that remote aerial inspection can add value for insurance companies — as in the following story.

Trouble in Paradise
Earlier this year, a major fire broke out at a vacation destination on the coast of France and consumed more than 2 hectares (5 acres), destroying over 80 small housing units with damage valued at over 100 million euros.
Once the flames had subsided, the insurance company came in to assess the damage. The sheer size of the site posed a unique challenge. To make matters worse, many of the roofs damaged by fire were made of thatch and were not strong enough to support an inspector climbing on them to inspect damage. The loss adjuster quickly realized that it would be very difficult to get a clear picture of what had happened from the ground.
Although a plane had already captured some photos after the disaster, the photos were not sharp enough to be of much use. The loss adjuster recommended the insurance company use a drone to help assess the area, so the insurance company hired Dronotec to map the site.

Once on site, the drone pilot flew a DJI Phantom 3 and automated his flight plan using the DroneDeploy app. It only took about 10–12 minutes , flying at 55 meter (180 feet) for the Phantom 3 to collect more than 300 geo-tagged photos covering the area. The drone pilot also supplemented the automated DroneDeploy flight with some oblique imagery taken manually using the DJI GO app.
Dronotec then uploaded all the imagery to DroneDeploy for processing. Three hours later, a 2D map and 3D model were complete and available in the cloud. That’s when the real work began.

Collaborating to Determine Responsibility
Since the map was hosted on the DroneDeploy cloud, it could be easily shared via email or by hyperlink and became a central tool where the team could collaborate and share findings.
“My favorite thing about DroneDeploy, is that it’s easy to use and easy to share,” said Emilien. [click to tweet]
Information collected on site by the loss adjuster and insurance inspector, as well as meteorological data about wind direction, was added to the plan as notes, comments and measurements. In addition to counting the number of damaged units (80), the map, combined with DroneDeploy’s suite of analysis tools, allowed them to instantly estimate the volume of debris to be removed.

In this case, the main issue at stake was how the fire had spread and who was responsible. As the team began analyzing the map, several theories emerged. The first hypothesis was based on the wind direction on the day of the fire, and posited that the fire had begun at a neighboring field on the north side of the housing after burning of old vegetation for agricultural purposes.
The blue arrow shows wind direction the day of the fire. The blue marker and pink markers show approximate proposed origins for the fire.
The lack of fire damage in the field, however, didn’t support this theory, so the team then considered the wind direction again. Clearly, the fire had spread from northwest (top left) through to the southeast (lower right). After looking closely at the the northwesterly-most point of damage, they identified the first few units to be consumed by the blaze and determined that the fire must have started in or around one of the housing units in this area. Since these units were not on their customer’s property, the insurance company could demonstrate that their customer was not responsible for the fire and thus deny the responsibility claim.
The drone map enabled the insurance company to limit their costs to the 15,000 euro technical investigation and deny the 100,000,000 euro claim. [Click to tweet]
When it comes to a disaster of this scale, the cost of the use of the drone — about .002% of the total claim — is trivial compared to the amount of money saved by demonstrating that the customer was not responsible. More importantly, “there was no other way to gather data”, said Emilien.
Aerial photos from the scene of the fire.
Insurance for the Insurer
The high degree of accuracy that drone maps provide helps improve the likelihood of identifying the cause of an accident. In some cases, like in the one above at the French vacation site, this helps an insurance company decline a claim if they are not responsible. But what about when their client is responsible? Even in these situations, the speed and efficiency of drone mapping can help to reduce costs and damages for everyone involved.
In many claims, damages related to “business interruption” represent a significant part of the overall damages being sought. Delays in the site inspection or assessment process can even cause conditions on site to get worse, increasing the overall damage. Therefore, the faster that the insurance company can accurately assess a claim, the faster reconstruction can begin, and the more that downtime — and related damages — can be minimized.
The ability to quickly process claims — and even anticipate them — is especially helpful in the case of large scale disasters where many customers are affected and the company is inundated by many claims at once.
Using drones to capture a highly detailed rendering of the site saves time on two fronts. On the one hand, a drone can dramatically reduce the amount of time that a loss adjuster needs to spend on site and reduce risk of accident at dangerous sites. Secondly, the quality of the information captured, and the ability to easily collaborate on a web-based map can help adjusters and insurance inspectors complete their analysis faster.
“The way I see it, DroneDeploy is insurance for the insurer,” said Emilen. [click to tweet]
By reducing the time it takes to assess claims, drone maps can save insurance companies time and help the insuree to get ‘back on track’ faster.
An Ounce of Prevention
Drones are rapidly being adopted for loss assessment in the insurance industry, and Emilien expects that over the next few years, drones will be used to assess claims almost everywhere in the world. But Emilien’s not only interested in using drones to help assess disasters — he also thinks they have a role in helping to prevent them.
Before issuing a new insurance policy, insurance companies can use drones to inspect properties and verify the risks to be covered by the insurance company. Once risks have been identified, the insurance company can then work with their prospect or customer to mitigate risks and help prevent disaster.

Should I Get My Teeth Cleaned Without Dental Insurance?
My health insurer wants me to sign up for a dental plan, but I’m not sure it’s the best financial choice.
The Simpsons
My last dental checkup was in either late 2011 or early 2012, back when dental care was included as part of my employer-based health insurance package. (These were the pre-freelance years.)
So, when my health insurer sent me an email inviting me to add dental coverage to my Bronze health insurance, I figured I’d take a look.
The package in itself doesn’t seem that bad. I can choose between a $50 and a $75 deductible, which entitles me to two oral exams and teeth cleaning per year at a $20 copay each. More serious dental work, such as root canals, runs in the $400 range, but I’m mostly interested in the teeth cleaning. (There’s this tiny gap between my bottom two front teeth that slowly fills up with plaque, and even though I can knock some of it out by daily flossing, I can never get it as clean as the dental hygienist does.)
The premiums don’t look that bad either, until you add them all up; the $75 deductible dental plan would cost me $30.40 per month, or $364.80 a year. (Probably a little more than that, because I’ll turn 35 in November and transition into the $32.10 per month bracket.)
When I look at that $364.80 figure—plus the copays and the $75 deductible—I feel like it would be smarter to go pay for a teeth cleaning out of pocket, the way I pay for my annual eye exam out of pocket.
The Cost of Getting Your Eyes Checked (When Your Health Insurance Does Not Include Vision)
Last year, I got my eyes checked for the first time since 2011 because I was suffering from a little eyestrain…medium.com
My most recent eye exam cost $184.30. If I can get my teeth cleaned for roughly the same amount, I could save over $200.
Here’s the funny thing: dentist websites don’t like to tell you how much an out-of-pocket teeth cleaning costs. (They don’t like to tell you how much anything costs.) In fact, when you stop looking at local dentist websites and search “dental costs without insurance,” one of the top results is a Billfold article by Meaghan O'Connell:
How Much Should the Dentist Cost?
A few hours before my dentist appointment yesterday, the office left me a voicemail warning me that the insurance I…medium.com
The fact that The Billfold is a top source for “dental costs without insurance” is both proof that we’re awesome and that there is so little other information out there. (It might also be proof that Google knows I work for The Billfold, so I’d be interested to see where the article shows up in your search results.)
Meaghan paid $200 out-of-pocket for her teeth cleaning, and reconciles the expense as follows:
On the walk home I was thinking about $200, and if that experience was worth it. On one hand, NO. On the other hand, what should it cost? I pay $80 for a haircut if you include tip, and this involved scraping plaque off of my teeth, and suctioning spit and blood out of my mouth, and like, getting sprayed in the eyes with whatever they use to do the polishing part (the worst). I don’t think I would perform that service on someone for less than $200, so I accept it.
For me, this whole dental dilemma is less about whether it would be better for me to go pay for a $200 teeth cleaning out of pocket or sign up for the $364.80-plus-copay-and-deductible insurance. (In my individual situation, knowing my pain-free mouth and history of daily flossing, of course I would be better off paying for a teeth cleaning out of pocket, and I should just find a dentist and go.)
It’s more about having no real information on which to make an educated decision except a Billfold article.
There is one more way of getting real information, of course, and it involves calling the dental offices directly. (Yes, it’s worth noting that I almost forgot that I could do this.) I talked to a few dental offices and learned that, yes, a standard teeth cleaning and exam with X-rays will run around $200 without insurance—which does mean that it would be less expensive to just get the teeth cleaning and not get the dental insurance, if I’m willing to trust my gut instinct that my teeth are fine and just need a little plaque scraping.
Would you pay $364.80 plus copay and deductibles for dental insurance? Would you pay $200 for the teeth cleaning? Or would you just keep on flossing and brushing and hoping you were doing a good enough job?

What is the Value of Bond Insurance?
Some thoughts on underwriting standards and the loss of ratings arbitrage
It is remarkable how porous historical accounts of the bond insurance industry have become. Articles written about the industry almost never discuss ratings arbitrage, for example. Ratings arbitrage was the raison d’être of bond insurance before the financial crisis.
These holes in the narrative are significant because what is missing would inform investors about the value of bond insurance in the market now. (This might not be an accident.)
In 2007, roughly half of new municipal bond issues carried bond insurance. (This equates to hundreds of billions of dollars in volume.) The bond insurance industry was decimated during the financial crisis due to their heavy exposure to toxic mortgage-backed securities.
In 2014, only about $18.6 billion of new municipal bond issues were wrapped. Most of this volume is attributable to two firms, Assured Guaranty and Build America Mutual (BAM). Assured Guaranty wrapped $9.9 billion, giving it a market share of 53.5%. BAM wrapped $7.5 billion of bonds, giving it a market share of 40.4%.
One might look at these figures and assume that this is a story about how the industry made a lot of bad bets and two companies are slowly building it back again. That is happening, but the story isn't that simple.
Before the financial crisis, the rating agencies rated municipal bonds on a scale that was unique to the municipal bond market. The rating scales made comparing municipals to other asset classes impossible. Municipal bonds were rated below corporate credits with objectively similar credit profiles.
The rating agencies aggressively defended this practice. They claimed that it was necessary to show “granular” differences between municipal credits since municipal defaults are extremely rare. But this did not reflect how the market used the ratings. State and local governments were unnecessarily penalized with higher yields until Congress forced the rating agencies to adopt universal scales.
These artificial disparities created a captive market for bond insurers, which is how they ended up wrapping half of the market. Insurers were writing policies to cover the risk of default on thousands of credits that had remote chances of defaulting. And somehow they decided to ruin that gig by backstopping toxic waste.
This arrangement had a perverse effect on the bond market. The rating agencies wanted to use a separate scale to show granular differences in municipal credits. The bond insurance companies (that the rating agencies kept in business) actually removed all granular differences in perceived creditworthiness. It didn't matter to investors if they were buying a state with a AA underlying rating and the ability to levy taxes or a barely investment grade conference center. Everything was AAA. Nothing about this structure was healthy.
It wasn't until the destruction of the bond insurance industry during the financial crisis that investors started to look at what they owned and bonds started to trade accordingly. It is unlikely that investors will forget this experience anytime soon.
So what value does bond insurance provide to investors in the current environment? The insurers have been using high-profile defaults like Detroit (and probably Puerto Rico soon) as evidence of the value of their product. And it is true — the investors that had bond insurance in Detroit were glad they had it, because they would have been mostly wiped out by a rogue bankruptcy court otherwise.
But these credits are outliers and that is unlikely to change. It is also worth noting that in cases like Detroit and Harrisburg, the impression that investors were covered facilitated the governments borrowing past the point where they should not have had market access. (This kind of behavior is why downward spirals take longer than one would otherwise expect. Not to mention the fact that these deals involved fraud.)
With the paucity of new supply in the market, most new bond issues are massively oversubscribed. When deals are bound to be oversubscribed, borrowers have no incentive to include strict covenants or pay a premium for bond insurance. Investors will be fighting each other for the bonds anyway. Also, as my friend @StevePendergast observed, “compression of rates makes [the] incremental value of a wrap less important and [the] premium more expensive.
There might still be opportunities for ratings arbitrage of a different stripe, where an issuer has been arbitrarily rated below where it should be. But given how picked over the markets are from a long period of extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy, this seems difficult to do.
So have underwriting practices flipped from safe underwriting to (relatively) toxic underwriting in the current environment? This seems like it would be worth studying. It wouldn't have a large impact on the market as a whole — as I pointed out earlier, this has become a very tight niche.

The rejuvenation of insurance — this is why it matters

Non-specialists rarely think about insurance in their day-to-day life. Most people don’t interact much with their insurer, unless they have a claim — the industry actually has one of fewest annual customer touchpoints.
Yet, insurance is one of the largest industries in the world, with global annual revenues north of $4.75 trillion, including more than $1 trillion here in the United States. And since most of the world is still uninsured, opportunities for growth are significant.
Over the past few years, the industry has been undergoing a transformation — one that is necessary and will have significant impact on the way it operates, its customers, and who the sector leaders will be 10 years from now. More on that in a moment, but first let us review some of the basics of insurance.
The underwriting/asset management equation
The traditional insurance business model for many years was to select risks and charge adequate premiums — a process called underwriting — that will provide a reasonable net profit. Careful liability management was such that underwriting profits were common for property/casualty (P&C) insurance in the U.S. before the 1980s; 40 of the 60 years before 1980 were profitable.
But over time, competition and regulatory pressure, as well as too much unmanaged risk-taking focused on short-term volume growth versus value, changed the landscape. The underwriting part of the P&C insurance model has been mostly losing money for the decades that followed the ’80s: not a single underwriting profit year was recorded from 1979 through 2003 here in the United States. This is not to say that every insurer had underwriting losses year after year, but altogether they did.
So you might wonder how this can be sustainable. The answer lies in assets under management. When an insurer collects a premium, some of it is invested. If investment returns are good enough, they exceed underwriting losses, leading to overall profits. In other words, underwriting losses had been manageable thanks to high investment revenues. But this model has been challenged in the 21st Century.
Two drivers of change
First came a series of catastrophes that impacted underwriting results — think 9/11 terrorist attacks, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Japanese tsunami in 2010, Thailand floods in 2011, Superstorm Sandy in 2012, pandemics, technological disasters, geopolitical risks, and increasing number and scale of cyber-attacks, to name just a few. In fact, the average annual cost of natural disasters around the world increased more than 300% from $46 billion over the period 1980–1985, to $188 billion for 2011–2015. And the cost inflicted by cyber-attacks globally is now higher than of natural disasters (although most of it remains uninsured, as of yet).
No wonder that extreme weather events and cyber-risks were two of the top risks in the Forum’s 2016 Global Risks Report. The occurrence of many more “tail” events have triggered a renewed interest in better selecting what risks to insure, under what conditions, and at what price. Moreover, in a fast-changing and highly interdependent environment, risks are becoming more interdependent too, and new risks are emerging, making assessment by traditional actuarial approaches more challenging, if not inappropriate. The past alone cannot predict the future anymore.
The other game changer for many insurers came, more abruptly, with the 2008 financial crisis. It significantly destroyed asset value and led to numerous regulations. Combined with a stagnant low interest rate environment, many asset managers, including insurers, are unable to achieve the investment returns they once enjoyed.
The underwriting/asset management equation, so central to the insurance model, has to be rethought. In other words, insurers need to design and implement strategies that will help them measurably improve underwriting performance again, meet evolving demand and create value.
New strategic thinking towards better risk selection
This new reality has triggered fresh thinking and innovations at a pace that the industry has probably not seen for a long time. Large insurers, typically the incumbents, are challenged by newcomers who want to disrupt the market with new technologies, and are backed by venture capitalists. The word InsureTech, recently coined, refers to technologies and platforms that optimize insurance operations. Last year marked a substantial shift: investment in insurance tech reached $2.65 billion, reflecting the growth happening in the start-up arena for insurance technology.
Large insurers are engaged in an important transformation as well. For instance, American International Group (AIG)’s new chief underwriting officer for its large commercial-insurance unit is not a trained underwriter — he is a data scientist, signifying a sweeping change in the industry. The soon-to-be new CEO of the large French insurer AXA has also publicly stated that improving usage of data and developing predictive analytics will be key to improving risk management practices, strategic decision making and competitiveness.
We are now seeing more companies spending a fair amount of time and money upgrading their risk selection processes, from improving their understanding of their maximum exposure to extreme events around the world (direct, business interruption, contingent business interruption), to extracting information from decades of claims data and combining those with other sources of knowledge. More firms are also moving to directly empower consumers along their insurance journey, rather than relying solely on agents and brokers and on a single annual renewal touchpoint.
More granular, just-in-time and agile risk knowledge is pushing the transformation further
The increasing role of technology is helping insurance companies make smarter assessments of risk and helping their clients be safer, too. The technology is able to aggregate and combine data in a way that is accessible 24/7 and easily understood by busy decision makers. After all, people expect companies like Amazon, Expedia or Google to respond to multiple queries at the speed of light these days. We are all getting use to this “right now” mentality.
One of these start-ups, Maptycs, for instance, has developed new high-performing geographic information systems allowing users to collect and analyze a vast amount of data in a user-friendly, mobile compatible platform. One can now geo-locate and calculate exposure to different types of risks for more than one million physical assets on the planet. Ten years ago, it may have taken a week or more for a team to generate that information. Today, this is done in less than five seconds.
Recent developments are such that any authorized employee can now use a smart phone to receive alerts should certain risks materialize or in a few clicks to perform pre-programed analyses on exposure for all or part of the insured portfolio, and immediately share results.
Digitization progress makes complex analyses and stress-tests of insurance portfolios much easier, reduces operation costs and human biases, help tailor investment in risk management activities, price the risk more granularly and transparently, improve product design, all positively impacting delivery and performance.
This regained emphasis on liability management is true for property/casualty and was shown in recent McKinsey studies (the “Journey” white paper series) to be a key differentiating factor of success in life/health insurance as well.
The ongoing rejuvenation of the P&C industry has started to show results. 2013, 2014 and 2015 were three consecutive years of underwriting profits here in the U.S for the first time since the early 1970s. We will have to see if these results will hold in the face of future catastrophes.
Beyond insurance, risk and resilience are now in the boardroom
The new normal — increased recurrence of severe extreme events of all sorts, growing uncertainty, intensifying regulation, low interest rates impacting asset management, different consumer expectations, better use of modern technology and the quest for resilience — has obviously a much wider impact than just on the insurance industry. As one good barometer, the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos earlier this year devoted a large number of sessions to these very issues.
My Wharton colleagues Howard Kunreuther, Michael Useem and I have recently conducted interviews of executives, CEOs and directors of the board of 100 firms in the S&P 500; replicated by colleagues in Germany as well, the research findings confirm that the risk management and resilience landscape is fundamentally changing — how it is performed, by whom, and its increasing importance in C-suites and boards. Once seen as fairly technical and dry, it has now become strategic, and more fun to work on.
Meanwhile, the gap between the top performers who have embraced change and executed on it, and those who have not, is widening.

Social media intelligence and profiling in the insurance industry…
…it’s not only the price you pay that will be affected

This piece was written by PI research officer Dr. Tom Fisher.
The financial services industry is eager to gather more and more data about our lives. Apart from mining the data they have historically collected such as credit history, they are looking to use our social media profiles to reach into our friendships and social interactions. They are using these data in new and unexpected ways, including personality profiling to determine the risk of lending to you, and thus the price you will pay.
Firstcarquote, a product from the car insurance company Admiral Insurance, is a leading example of such unexpected data exploitation. In a semi-aborted product launch in November 2016, the company proposed to use young drivers’ Facebook posts to determine their personality and use this information to offer discounts on car insurance. Not limited to causing damage to its own reputation, Admiral’s move raises serious questions about the future of the insurance industry.
While Admiral may have been forced into backing away from the use of young people’s Facebook posts to price insurance, the company is still working with companies that are involved in in the business of personality profiling and using social media intelligence to make predictions and decisions about people. Social media intelligence is collecting and analysing data from social media networks, like Facebook; this can include information contained in profiles, posts, images, and metadata like location. Are we ready for the consequence of social media-based risk scoring?
Admiral’s firstcarquote
In November 2016, Admiral Insurance announced a new product, firstcarquote, which used Facebook profile posts to determine young drivers’ personality and risk profile. Media coverage was amplified when Facebook announced the product would be blocked for breaking the terms of their Platform Policy.
The exercise may have been a media stunt for “a fairly standard new app for first time drivers” allowing Admiral to claim on firstcarquote.com it was “Probably the most talked about car insurance product ever …”. After the failure of the first lauch attempt, Firstcarquote then relaunched with a mandatory “login via Facebook” and personality quiz replacing the analysis of Facebook posts.

Personality profiling and insurance
This interest in social media intelligence was not just a one-off flirtation by Admiral. Data from social media is beginning to play a growing role in the financial sector, and Admiral continues to market personality profiling as a legitimate way to offer young drivers discounts on their car insurance.
In relation to firstcarquote, the app still has a mandatory Facebook sign in, but this grants access to “account information”, rather than a person’s posts. Account information is an individual’s name, email address, gender, birth date, current city, and their profile picture. An app that asks for this information is not required to go through Facebook’s app review process.
More interesting and less covered than the app is Admiral’s collaboration with VisualDNA. VisualDNA is a personality profiling company, with a focus on credit scoring for lenders. According to a MasterCard report, VisualDNA’s work in the credit sector measures attributes like “openness”, “neuroticism”, and “emotional stability” to assist with credit scoring, particularly for those “thin-file” customers who had a limited credit history.
Both parties saw this as beneficial partnership. VisualDNA, who having “already proven the benefits of applying our patented and unique psychometric tests to credit assessment” were “delighted to have the opportunity to work with Admiral to demonstrate the power of this approach to other forms of risk assessment such as motor [insurance].” Equally, Admiral believed “The more we know about our customers’ likely behaviour the better placed we are to price risk on an individual basis, giving customers an even more accurate price.”
The depth of the relationship is perhaps seen in the involvement of computer scientist Dr. Yossi Borenstein as “principal data scientist on firstcarquote”, who had previously worked with VisualDNA, where he was head of risk analytics. He has also published on the subject of VisualDNA’s personality tests.
Further, Admiral use VisualDNA’s cookie on their website, although it is unclear as to whether this is for profiling for advertising or risk purposes.
Admiral’s initial press release made a broad claim for the validity of personality testing for young driver insurance: “It’s scientifically proven that some personalities are more likely to have an accident than others.” They later weakened this to “a growing body of scientific evidence that…personality traits can be linked to driving risk”. Finally, as a post on their Facebook page puts it, “So, does your personality affect the way you drive? The short answer is: probably.” But, whether there this is a link between risk and personality for young drivers or not, the use of personality testing, and new data sources, has broader consequences for the insurance sector.
Social media data as intelligence
The use of social media intelligence is a developing field in the financial sector. Facebook’s Platform Policy may have prevented access to the data about people’s posts on this occasion, but the use of social media data to make predictions and decisions about people in the insurance sector is developing.
In this instance, the firstcarquote case attracted a great deal of publicity and Facebook deemed that the initial version of firstcarquote violated its platform policy. It purportedly measured personality by analysing, for example sentence length and use of exclamation marks; words like “always” or “never” (as opposed to “maybe”) could suggest overconfidence; and arranging to make appointments at a specific time, rather than a generic “this evening”, was allegedly a measure of how organized an individual is. Facebook’s platform policy governs how third-party apps can make use of Facebook. According to Facebook, Admiral violated term 3.15, which was introduced into the policy in May 2016:
“Don’t use data obtained from Facebook to make decisions about eligibility, including whether to approve or reject an application or how much interest to charge on a loan.”
Despite this, data from social media still play a role in the financial services industry. This is particularly the case for groups of people who have not had access to financial data before — requiring these sectors of society to be required to reveal more about themselves than others. For example, the use of social media intelligence for loans is aimed at those who do not have an existing credit history — typically, the poorest and most vulnerable. Similarly, with firstcarquote, it was a group without previous access to affordable insurance who were required to reveal more about themselves. It begins to seemthat some groups in society are more able to keep their privacy than others. Is this fair?
One typical example of the use of social media data is the work of Big Data Scoring (BDS), a credit scoring company who took on Admiral as a client in March 2016 announcing at that time, BDS “tap[s] into the broadest source of information from across the Internet, using all publicly available information”.
One of their products, BDS’ Digital Footprint DATA gathers information from a variety of sources that are considered ‘publicly available’, including some social media, blogs, and information through Google searches. It checks information like the device a person is using, and detailed information about their location. We note that the description of the cookie on the Admiral site includes,
“information about the user’s web browser and computer, which pages are accessed on the loan application site, how long the user spends on each page, how the user interacts with the pages and what actions they take during their visit.”
Detecting how a website is used can be a tool for fraud detection, and detecting bots. But cookies gather data on every user of the loan site: the way in which you fill in an online form is becoming as important as the information we put into the form.
BDS’ original product from 2013–4, offered a social media score to loan providers to supplement or replace their existing decision-making processes. After giving access to a broad range of Facebook data — including profile data, status updates, likes, and locations — the algorithm made a decision on the likelihood that an individual would repay a loan. As the CEO and co-founder, Erki Kert, stated,
“All in all, that is c.a. 5,000–10,000 lines of data for each client. …. We often know more about borrowers than their family or relatives do.”
He also downplayed the serious privacy implications of such a statement:
“From applicants point of view, allowing access to all this Facebook data costs just 2 mouse clicks”.
The social consequences of industry shaping human behaviour
Young driver insurance doesn’t just affect the wallets of young drivers: it has an impact on society more broadly. The price of insurance isn’t only a measure of risk: it also potentially affects behaviour. And influencing the behaviour of young drivers is important. Despite making up less than 2% of license holders, young drivers are involved in almost 10% of all fatal and serious crashes.
More traditional pricing has the potential to have a positive impact on the safety of our roads: for instance, by pricing more powerful (and risky) cars higher, it encourages young drivers to choose more appropriate vehicles. While the price of insurance isn’t the only factor affecting the behaviour of young drivers, it is as the very least using another tool to encourage them to use the roads more safely, benefiting us all.
But, think about how basing price on social media posts would change behaviour. Would encouraging young people to use full sentences on Facebook do anything to make roads safer? Where is the social benefit of that?
In fact, we can see a social harm in the using social media in this way in financial services. It can change the way we communicate, which affects us all: it removes the honesty from our communications if we think that it might affect our financial standing. Is a friend posting a message because of a genuine desire to share their lives with their friends and followers, or are they giving a particular impression because they’re looking to apply for a mortgage in 6 months time?
The elements of social control in this can be more insidious. For instance, China is developing a social credit system; this is reportedly a method to influence behaviour online by developing a “social credit score”. Similarly, a lender in India is rejecting loan applications from people who post political messages on Twitter, as the lender fears that it is more difficult to get money back from the politically active if they don’t repay.
The future of the insurance sector
As the CEO of the financial services tech firm ZestFinance, and former Chief Information Officer of Google said in 2013, “We feel like all data is credit data, we just don’t know how to use it yet.”. The same could be said of the insurance industry, but this has consequences for the insurance industry itself.
A 2016 UK Financial Conduct Authority publication on the role of “big data” in the consumer financial market, identified as a risk the increased segmentation of the market, with the consequence that those customers deemed riskier are priced out the ability to get affordable insurance.
The risk can be taken to its conclusion: with more and more data collected, with a strong claim of the predictive power of algorithms, the size of the segments in the market are reduced, eventually to one. In other words, an insurance company would be able to quantify the precise risk of an individual. At some point along this process, insurance as we know it faces an existential threat: insurers are no longer working on the basis of collectivised risk that is at the heart of insurance. Thus the change to insurance, and how it works is a major one — that affects all of us in society.
Conclusion
Despite the measures taken by Facebook, it’s clear that both personality profiling and social media intelligence continue to have a continuing relevance in the insurance sector. This presents a challenge that goes beyond the price that individuals pay for their insurance, and it affects us all. We have to ask the question, is this fair? And, ultimately, there is a danger to the insurance industry itself.
Using social media intelligence in the financial services industry risks affecting how we present ourselves on social media. The selves that we present on social media become the selves that we would present at a meeting with our bank manager: feeling slightly uncomfortable in our Sunday Best, avoiding at all costs controversy, politics, and protest. That is, at the very least, a less interesting world to live in.

For-profit health insurance trumping public schools: HRC 6/100
3 August, 2016 | Index
Dear Hillary Clinton,
Gerard Mclean again, writing to you from my kitchen table in Englewood, Ohio. This is letter 6 of 100. The previous ones are posted online at 100HRC.com as well as delivered via USPS to your office.
On Monday, August 1, my letter contained a dollar amount I will conservatively pay just for medical insurance premiums. The insurance premiums I’ve paid so far this year to the for-profit Anthem BC/BS of Ohio is more than I have paid in taxes to support public education in Ohio all last year. Fewer statistics say more about the values of contemporary America than this one.
What is wrong with us?
Tax dollars educate the next generation of Ohioans. Dollars spent for health insurance premiums do not even provide one hour of actual medical care to this generation.
The status quo in health care policy is bankrupting and killing us. We need your administration — if elected — to focus on #MedicareForAll #UniversalCare #SinglePayer
It is that urgent.
Regards,

Gerard McLean

More on Family, Caretaking, and Supplementary Health Insurance
Photo credit: Wendy Harman, CC BY 2.0.
In the past two days I’ve shared posts on supplementary health insurance and family, caretaking, and the economy.
The Washington Post has a new story that tries to tie these two ideas together—but discovers the frayed ends don’t quite meet.
I needed to find care for my elderly aunt. What I found was an eldercare crisis.
The call came right after lunchtime. "I've fallen again." My great-aunt Emma sounded frustrated and frail. Her arm hurt…www.washingtonpost.com
When writer A.K. Whitney’s great-aunt Emma falls and breaks her arm, they turn towards Emma’s multiple insurance policies for help and come up short:
But because she hadn’t required surgery, insurance wouldn’t cover the astronomical costs of a rehab center. Nor would the long-term care insurance she’d been paying steep premiums to for years (unlike me, Emma has never been in denial of her frailty, taking care of everything from living wills to DNRs to funeral arrangements) kick in for at least three months. The doctor told us it would only take six weeks (barring re-injury) before she was out of the sling.
I don’t have access to Emma’s long-term care insurance policy, but if I read that paragraph correctly, it looks like people who need long-term care are on their own for at least three months, right? I pulled up a long-term care insurance brochure from Premera to see what they offered, and found this:
You even have choices about how long you will need to wait to start receiving monthly cash benefits: Choose the number of Calendar Days in your Elimination Period — 30, 60, 90, 180, or 365 days.
Then I compared it to a long-term insurance brochure from MetLife:
Typically, you become eligible when you are unable to perform two out of the six Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). This number may vary from insurer to insurer. Also, the period of time when you are unable to perform the ADLs should be anticipated to last for at least 90 days. You will also need to have satisfied the elimination period. Policies start to pay once you are eligible and have met the elimination period.
As you can probably guess, the shorter the Elimination Period, the higher the premium. Of course, even a short elimination period wouldn’t have helped someone like Emma if she were on a long-term insurance plan that required her to be in need of care for “at least 90 days” before they’d offer help.
So what do you do when a loved one needs roughly six weeks of at-home care? Some of us might say “well, that’s where you step in.” Whitney explains why it isn’t always that easy:
Moving in with me wasn’t an option, and neither was me moving in with her. I could help with laundry, groceries, cooking and chauffeuring, but helping her bathe was off the list, since I have physical challenges of my own. It was time to look into home care.
As a thought exercise, consider what you’d do if a family member who did not live in your home suddenly needed full-time care for the next six weeks. Would you be able to take leave from your job? Would you be eligible for FMLA? Would you temporarily relocate? Could you go without income for six weeks? (For some of us, this isn’t a thought exercise—it’s something we’ve already had to figure out. For others of us, it’s something we’re very likely to have to figure out in the future.)
At this point, Whitney gets Emma declared “homebound” so that Medicare will help to pay for some of Emma’s care expenses. However, she and Emma learn that while Medicare will pay for certain types of care, they won’t pay for a night nurse, which is Emma’s “most urgent need.” And no, Whitney can’t just sleep over at Emma’s; they need a night nurse who can stay awake and help Emma when she wakes up in the middle of the night.
So Whitney begins exploring the private market, using Emma’s savings to pay for the necessary care. You don’t need me—or anyone else—to tell you that at-home health care in the private market is both too expensive and not expensive enough; paying $16 or $21 an hour adds up, but learning that an individual home health care worker only gets a portion of that after the agency takes its fees is demoralizing. You might remember last year’s post about a Massachusetts home health care worker union successfully negotiating a $15 minimum wage, in which I quoted this ThinkProgress statistic on home health care workers’ earnings:
They make just $9.61 on average, while a quarter live in poverty and three in five rely on public benefits.
And sure, you could find a home health care worker outside of an agency, but that wouldn’t necessarily lower your own costs—and it would mean doing additional research to confirm that the person you were hiring was both capable and trustworthy.
Emma is fine now, and her broken arm has healed. But, as Whitney explained:
I now understand why one doctor told me a lot of people just wind up putting elders in nursing homes instead of having them stay home.
What would you do, if you were in Whitney and Emma’s situation? If you’ve been in a situation like this before, how did you make it work?

The National Disability Insurance Scheme
Looking back to see the future
By 2019, the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) will offer people with significant disability in Australia a measure of entitlement to support, greater choice and control in the delivery of that support, the prospect of much more personalised options and lifestyles and relatively easy portability of service resources across the country.
Some suggest that people with disability have not seen change of this magnitude since the Disability Services Act in 1986, which sought the participation and inclusion of people with disability in community life. Regardless, reforms of this kind are long overdue. The former National People with Disabilities and Carer Council’s Shut-Out Report in 2009 claimed people with disability were “excluded and ignored” in a system that was “broke and broken”.
In 2013, the Australian public massively supported a new system that would cost them an additional levy. In return, they expected people with disability to be given the ‘fair go’ they were due, and a chance to participate socially and financially in community life. The public now expects this change to be relatively swift and seamless.
Very early in the process some people with disability will likely make prompt decisions about their lives and not look back. The experience of the last thirty years, however, suggests much more long-term developmental challenges lie ahead. Change of this magnitude cannot be expected to be swift or easy. Looking back on past reforms offers some lessons that predict future challenges for the NDIS.
Traditional services will find change difficult
Self-directed individualised arrangements espoused by the NDIS have been around for some time to varying degrees across Australia. The change agents in the past who pioneered them were often people with disability themselves, their families and allies as well as some state governments who saw the need for this service approach to evolve. The larger traditional services as well as many equally conventional smaller ones up to the present can be remembered for their reluctance to change their existing practices and models in favour of people directing their own support. Their significant investment in property, fixed service models and increasingly corporate organisational structures gave considerable control and dominance to these traditional services and many people with disability and their families preferred their perceived reliability to the uncertainty of change. It can be expected that these traditional services will again make a convincing case that their clientele should stay in these same arrangements, and many people will — for the time being.
The plausibly realistic hope is for incremental change in the number of people electing to create highly individualised and self directed options as more and more people determine the direction of their own lives. This possible transformation will vary from State to State. Western Australia has supported families and people with disability to self-direct for decades, and the practice is now well established. In contrast, New South Wales has only recently gained a small measure of such experience, and it undoubtedly will be harder for many services to fundamentally change.
Entitlement will not be absolute
The NDIS was launched on a theme of service security and entitlement, and many people may consider this will be an entitlement in absolute terms. The past suggests this will not be the case. Reforms for greater equity and inclusion for people with disability have been consistently underfunded for decades, and although the Government has given priority to people with disability recently, this attention is unlikely to last. Further, governments cannot give absolute guarantees of financial resources. All systems have limitations, and as Australia heads into an uncertain economic future, the NDIS will not be immune.
People with disability will take time to build capacity
People also speak of “choice and control” as an absolute — you either have these or you do not. Choice and control are on a continuum, and a continuum in different dimensions in life. In this sense, choice and control are always going to be issues to be negotiated to some degree. Previous service arrangements in the past gave people with disability little capacity to direct their own lives. The NDIS does offer people with disability and families the opportunity to build capacity to negotiate more options; however, it will be an ongoing challenge, rather than a settled matter. Individual funding and self-direction are not panaceas and there are many challenges involved in making life better. Hence, the question of what other supports may strengthen their hand needs to be more carefully examined.
Funding will not buy a good life
It is also suggested that, if people with disability and families are given the authority, they will know what they want out of life and services will inevitably do their bidding. Funding doesn’t automatically make a good life for people nor does it invariably make lifestyle development and services creative. Both people with disability and services will need courage and help to be creative and to imagine and pursue a better life. Being creative means struggle, discomfort, and doing something different with many errors and setbacks.
In the past, it was hard for services to change and the bigger the service, the harder it proved to be. The impetus for change to this point has largely come from smaller initiatives that worked in partnership with people with disability and their families. It will be hard to bring that kind of quality to scale without additional support for competent community-led capacity development as part of the normal ongoing strategy of the NDIS.
Again, it can be expected that pockets of change will pop up here and there where leaders relish the discomfort and the opportunity to be creative. The change will need to be ground-up and driven by these leaders, small agencies and possible deliberate agency transformations — rather than a top-down prescription for the service system by technocrats lacking experience with what is involved in assuring quality outcomes “one person at a time”. The NDIS will be wise to build the capacity of these “bottom up” leaders — people with disability, families and their allies — as agents of change.
It will be critical to start and stay with the person
Our past service system identified some people as “difficult to serve”. When people are put in the wrong setting with the wrong support at the wrong time, there will be difficulties. The NDIS offers a great opportunity to serve people better, to start with the person, to get the support right and to tailor that support over time. The better an individual pattern of support fits the person, the better the outcomes.
Many programs in the past have begun with a high level of flexibility and, over time, the rules tend to accumulate to form standardised solutions. NDIS will do well to learn from this lesson. It will need to safeguard flexibility and negotiability if practices are to stay focused on the person, and not to fall into the trap of using individual funding to purchase prescribed “same-old” service solutions.
Life is more than services: People with disabilities need friends and allies
In spite of the rhetoric of inclusion and participation in past programs, many people have ended up with little more than segregated custodial care. Not enough attention has gone into focusing on the person having a good life. The NDIS will need to address the fundamental tension between the life goals of a person and custodial outcomes and preoccupations of services. One answer is the rightful and critical presence of natural supporters, people with freely-given connections and relationships with the person. If the NDIS overlooks these, it will potentially subjugate a person’s life to a reliance solely on money and bureaucracy, and deny them the hearts, minds and gifts of ordinary people in the community. Further, it will have betrayed the current public interest in people with disability contributing to society, having a good life and getting a fair go.
Need for ongoing advocacy
It would be naïve to portray the NDIS, formal services and much of the generic resources of communities as necessarily always being faithful to people with disability and their families. Indeed, a more realistic view would be to see them as part of the problem of why life has been so hard for people with disability. Indeed, many reforms in the past have resulted from people with disability and their allies speaking out through funded advocacy support. One needs to ask who will support people with disability in the future to challenge these powerful interests when they do not get it right. Part of the “fair go” moral mandate from the public to the NDIS is to ensure that people with disability are treated fairly and they have the means to make their case.
The NDIS will not ensure an immediate change within the disability sector to self-direction for people with disability and greater choice and control over their lives. Rather, it is more likely to happen incrementally over time. People with disability, their families and their allies will continue to lead the change in small pockets of creativity across the Nation out of necessity because they cannot count on others to do this. The past thirty years are full of lessons of how programs with lofty ideals can lose their way. The NDIS must learn those lessons and people with disability, families and their allies must do their best to shape the NDIS to be their own. None of this will be easy, but great encouragement can come from seeing what has nevertheless been accomplished prior to the NDIS and it is exactly that kind of leadership that will shape its future.

National Insurance bites back
National insurance has nothing to do with insurance. Or benefits. Or anything else. It’s just a half-hidden, non-cumulative, non-relieveable, regressive income tax.

The UK’s National Insurance system is a triumph of marketing over reality. For years governments have been quietly hiding tax rises under the various forms of National Insurance while trumpeting loudly about how low the income tax rate had become.
This week the UK’s Chancellor, Philip Hammond, proposed a modest 2% rise in the rate of National Insurance — from 9% to 10% from April 2018 and then up to 11% from April 2019. The subsequent media storm has been a sight to behold for a 2% rise in a tax that affects less than 15% of the working population. The misinformation about National Insurance even more so. Finally the magical shine of National Insurance has started to wear off.
The Insurance
First let’s dispense with the primary myth about National Insurance — the insurance bit. National insurance is a weekly tax that is a throwback to the days when people were paid weekly in brown envelopes. That structure still exists in the system in the form of NICs (National Insurance Credits), which are still credited on a weekly basis. You get these if your earnings exceed the Lower Earning Limit of £112 per week. As soon as you go above that in a week you get a National Insurance Credit. If you don’t, you don’t get a credit. Older people still call these ‘stamps’ — because they used to be physical stamps on a card.
To get a full year’s increment on your state pension you have to have 52 credits in a tax year. If you have 51 or fewer you get nothing. (Don’t ask how I know this).
You’ll note that I haven’t mentioned any money changing hands yet — and that’s because no money does change hands to get the credit. There is a 0% band between £112 per week and £155 per week that gets you the national insurance credits. In other words they are free if you qualify.
This is the standard employee NI system — known as class 1 National Insurance. It doesn’t apply to the self-employed. They have their own system known as class 2 National Insurance which is currently £2.80 per week, but which is due to be abolished in April 2018 and replaced with a 0% profit band that is the same as employees on an annualised basis.
So once Philip Hammond’s changes go through, the self employed will be on the same credit basis as the employed.
So there is no insurance charge. Just a stupidly complicated and convoluted credit system half of which is there for historical reasons.
The Benefits
Much has been made about how the self employed get fewer National Insurance benefits than employed people do. It’s not really true. As the Citizen’s Advice Bureau puts it:
Class 2 contributions count towards the same benefits as Class 1, except that Class 2 will not usually count towards contribution-based Jobseeker’s Allowance.
Contributions based JSA means that your savings and partner’s income are disregarded when calculating the amount of Universal Credit you receive during periods you’re out of work. (The minimum income assumption is more insidious if you’re self-employed and that has nothing to do with National Insurance).
Payments of Holiday Pay, Statutory Sick Pay and even a chunk of Maternity Pay are actually funded by employers out of their own pocket as a statutory requirement. Add in the 3% pension contribution tax and you can see why employers want everybody to go self-employed.
Employers insure employees against sickness, maternity, holidays and additional pension, not the state.
The Tax
Which leaves National Insurance as just a tax, and quite a pernicious one at that.
Firstly it is levied weekly for employees, so if you’re weekly paid and get a bonus payment then you end up paying a huge amount of tax even if you don’t earn anything else that tax year. (Don’t ask me how I know this).
So it’s non-cumulative over the tax year.
If you have any expenses or allowances under the tax code, they don’t affect the amount of National Insurance paid. If you make a pension contribution personally as an employee you still pay National Insurance on that contribution, but not income tax. To get around this, you have to mess around doing ‘salary sacrifice’ so that you pay an employer contribution instead. If you didn’t want your employer to know about your pension contributions, you get to pay the tax. So much for personal pensions.
Similarly with the new childcare accounts vs. childcare vouchers or employer provided childcare.
So it’s non-relievable over the tax year.
The amount of National Insurance paid for employees is higher than income tax, but half of it is hidden as ‘Employers NI’.
A typical median salary person earning an additional amount of £100 will get £68 in their pocket and cost their employer £113.80 in total. That’s £20 of Income Tax and £25.80 National Insurance — split into £12 on the employee side and £13.80 on the employer side.
The overall tax rate is 40.2% of the cost to the employer of which National Insurance is 22.6%.
So it’s a half-hidden income tax that is 30% higher than actual income tax at the marginal basic rate.
To top it all, if your earnings are above £43,000 per annum, you end up with £58 in your pocket on that £100 rather than £68. Not quite the doubling in tax rate that is advertised for the Higher Rate.
Yes, as a wealthier person you get a reduction in your employee National Insurance — from 12% to 2%.
So it’s a regressive tax as well.
Which brings us to what the government is actually proposing for the self employed. The self-employed pay class 4 National Insurance as a pure tax, and currently pay class 2 National Insurance of £2.80 a week. Like this:
Current self employed National Insurance Regime
From April 2018 the existing proposal was to scrap class 2 National Insurance completely, saving the self employed £145.60 per year, which makes self employed National Insurance work like this:
Future self employed National Insurance regime
The Chancellor in his March 2017 budget proposed increasing class 4 National Insurance from 9% to 10% to coincide with the elimination of class 2 in April 2018 and then increase class 4 further to 11% in April 2019. This claws back the class 2 reduction previously announced.
A self employed person will only pay more National Insurance after April 2018 if they earn over £22,620, and over £15,340 after April 2019. Below that they are up on the deal.
If the median income self-employed person earns the £113.80 that an employee costs an employer, they will pay £11.38 National Insurance after April 2018 and £12.52 National Insurance after April 2019 — compared to £25.80 for an employee. Still a saving of £13.28 over an employee.
There are lots of advantages to self-employment, including saving a lot of National Insurance, but really it should be the clients of the self employed that fund the flexibility and the associated risks, not the state via tax breaks.
The politics of tax rises have become so toxic that chancellors are always trying to hide things in the shadows. Eventually that bites. Perhaps now National Insurance will be finally scrapped and rolled into a genuinely progressive Income Tax.

The biggest issue at this point is insurance won't cover the tests, and doctors I need and the costs are out of control. I had to switch to an HMO because Obama Care eliminated the PPO plan I was on, and I can’t afford the plan I need which would be upwards of $600–800 per month. Even if I win the lottery tomorrow it still wouldn’t necessarily get me to the doctors or tests I need because many of the decent doctors in the Bay Area no longer accept insurance.
The other issue is the health issues I’m dealing with are mostly ignored or misunderstood by Western medicine. I desperately need to see a naturopath, and I’ve seen one through my insurance in the past but my problems simply cannot be solved with a 30-minutes doctors appointment and she was young, stressed out, and seemed inexperienced. I was hustled in and out without resolution. The only people who will even give me an hour of their time won’t take insurance, and the cost of the tests I need are in the hundreds if not thousands of dollars and are not covered by insurance. I just can’t justify the expense right now to definitively know what’s going on.
I’m literally to the point where I just experiment with different herbs and remedies I research online and see if they help, because its cheaper to buy a $20 bottle of some herbs then it is to spend $350 for a Dr.’s appointment, and another $450+ on tests. If the tests confirm what I think is going on, it will be hundreds of dollars per month to resolve, and additional doctors appointments and tests as well.
What it ultimately comes down to is I can either pay for insurance and not get the care I need, or not have insurance and use the money to see the doctors I need. But if I do that, I will get fined by the IRS potentially until the Trump admin figures out this whole Obama Care nightmare.
At this point I’ve figured out the right combo of supplements and herbs to keep me functional, but I’m unable to get a proper diagnosis and fix what is wrong. Meanwhile, I’m paying out of pocket for a chiropractor right now just so I can even use my computer and be able to work without being in as much pain.
I’m managing but the system is so broken that petitioning the insurance companies wont help me.

Why You Should Not Escrow Your Taxes and Insurance
We recently refinanced a mortgage and somehow in the raping of many trees, I overlooked the page that allowed me to choose whether or not to escrow my taxes and insurance into my mortgage payment. If I had caught that page, I would have OPTED OUT but I guess my head was in the clouds that day.
If you are new to mortgages, here is what I’m talking about: Your monthly mortgage payment includes a principal payment plus amortized interest. The mortgage company usually gives you the option of paying a few hundred dollars extra per month so that they can keep that money in an escrow account to pay your annual property taxes and homeowners’ insurance. Isn’t that so kind of them?
Well, not really. They do not do this because they are kind. They do it for two reasons:
They are CYA‘ing. If you do not pay your property taxes, the city will take priority in a lien against the house (in most states). This means that if your house has to be sold at auction or foreclosed on, the city will get paid back first before the lender. The lender has no guarantee of being repaid in full. They get whatever scraps are left over from the emergency sale. The lender obviously doesn’t like this option.
They are also making money on your escrow account. Let me explain this.

I am not a lender so I am not 100% sure that the lender earns interest on your escrow account, although my insurance agent assures me that they do. But I do know that they do not have to pay YOU any interest whatsoever so you could be keeping thousands of dollars in this account per year, earning ZERO on it. Plus, they pad this account to make sure they have enough for these bills. The law allows them to estimate the total of taxes and insurance and add 1/6 more.
With this high cash reserve from your escrowed money, the bank can now lend out more money and make more money on those loans based on our system of fractional reserve banking.
I live in a very high property tax rate county. Taxes for homes in my area are regularly assessed at $20,000 per year. So do the opportunity-cost math for where you should put that $20,000 before it comes called up by the tax man.
Some interest-bearing account > 0 interest-bearing account
In some cases, the lender requires you to use an escrow account and charges you a one-time set-up fee to boot. But often you are given an option and if you are given the option, I suggest you opt out in the interest of maximizing the power of your dollars! Have the discipline to save this money yourself, put it in an interest-bearing account, and then you’ll have some extra dough left over to ease the pain of your tax bill.
Since I had neglected to do that on my recent refinance, I had to request to opt-out after the loan had closed by sending an actual fax. So old school! (Incidentally I do this with an iPad app called iFax. Comes in handy from time to time.)
Thankfully I really like our lender and they were super cool about this request. They dissolved the escrow account within a week and sent me a refund for the money they had been holding in there. My insurance agent was shocked that they were so breezy about it.
“If you were with Wells Fargo or one of the other big banks, I doubt they would have let you do that,” she said. “It’s getting increasingly hard to get the banks to give up a single penny because interest rates are so low and they are not making enough money on their loans.”
She makes a point!
She cautioned me that when that tax and insurance bills shows up, I should pay them pronto because if the bank gets an opportunity to pay it, they’ll jump at the chance to escrow me up again. Not sure if that is true but okay.
What about convenience?
I grant you, an escrow account is convenient. If you have not saved enough in taxes and you get that ugly bill in the mail, it puts a world of hurt on. And your property tax bill isn’t something you can affect very much, other than arguing with the city about your home’s value. For the most part, the government digs its heels in and makes you pay what they demand. Same with insurance bill. The cost is the cost and it is usually a high cost for homeowners.
If you really think you need to be forced to save this money inside of an escrow account, I applaud you for knowing the extent of your willpower. But if you are trying to play the smartest you possibly can with every dollar you spend, you already know the logical choice.
One last note of caution: Your lender does not know for sure how much your taxes and insurance for the next year will be. The city assesses tax values annually and your insurance rate can change too. Your lender estimates this amount and then pads the number in the escrow. They are required to disclose this to you. Look for this in your statements and make sure they are not holding too much of YOUR money.
Okay I’m done on this subject. Would love to hear what any experienced lenders have to say about this! You know how to respond so do so! Or subscribe to my mailing list by clicking here.

Health insurance CEOs are inept: HRC 21/100
18 August, 2016 | Index
Dear Hillary Clinton,
My name is Gerard Mclean, from Englewood, Ohio, ten miles north of Dayton, 68 miles west of Columbus, at the Crossroads of America where I70 & I75 meet. I’m writing you 100 letters, one for each day between your nomination and election. This is the twenty-first. The others can be found in your USPS mailbox or online at 100HRC.com
In my Wednesday letter, I mentioned an article that was published in the New York Times that I just can’t get out of my head. It outlined why health insurance companies felt they needed double-digit increases for 2017.
This is an industry that no longer needs to provide a product to cover anyone over 65. With the ACA, it has the Federal Government marketing its products via the Marketplace, does not need to market to anyone under 27 as their parents take care of that AND are guaranteed we will buy their products because of the individual mandate. In short, most of the common business problems we small business owners stress over are being done for them; marketing, sales, collections.
Yet, they justify the outrageous CEO salaries and perks because they reflect “the size and complexity of our business.” I’m confused about what complex problems the highly compensated CEOs are now expected to solve. Aren’t you?
I think Americans are quickly coming to the conclusion that private, for-profit health insurance corporations are simply inept at basic business. Why are we continuing to reward them for their incompetence by supporting them and approving their increases?
Universal Care, Medicare For All. Let’s roll.
Regards,

Hi…this is your auto insurance company and your car tells us you’re a shitty driver — Now, about those premiums.
The Emergence of Driver Performance Monitoring
HLSensory Overload: We’re Everywhere You’re Going To Be

The sign on the back of commercial vehicles often reads “How am I driving, call 1–800–555–1212. Safety is our priority”. We could assume that the majority of calls, if not all, received on customer service lines such as this one contain a wide range of complaints, most of which probably pertain to the truck being in someone’s way, or rude behavior, but not likely true safety concerns. While the idea of providing a resource to report bad driving seems like a good one, it is truly subjective and could lead to unnecessary discipline for drivers. But, oh well…too bad for him. That’s what he gets for getting in my way. However…
What if your mother-in-law backseat driver was replaced by artificial intelligence?

Now you are the one that is being monitored every time you get behind the wheel, and your car is a 4,000 pound stool pigeon. Driver performance monitoring is the official term, which is also known as vehicle telematics, for the use of remote sensors that capture everything a driver does, which is also a known form of artificial intelligence. Today, subjective customer service experiences can be compared with empirical data to give a fuller picture of what a driver did — or didn’t do — at any given time, if equipped with this monitoring technology. Whether you feel you were going too fast for conditions or not, the sensors in the vehicle will get the last word.
Driver performance monitoring collects various sensor-information from a vehicle and then transmits the data to a server. The server then analyzes the data based on established standards for performance and then issues alerts or reports when variances are recognized. Controls such as speed, braking, how many “Gs” were pulled in the curves, force on the brakes, use of turn signals, horn activations, cameras (back up cameras), AVL/GPS data, etc. are all collected and coordinated, so that a virtual digital picture can be presented that illustrates the performance of the driver.
In the case of public safety personnel, other sensors such as dashboard and body cameras, use of emergency lights and sirens, activation of a shotgun/rifle release, or emergency assistance buttons can be included in the sensor data collection. Instant alerts can be sent when various actions occur altering supervisors to unusual activity, such as an emergency assistance button activation or release of a shotgun/rifle.
Diagram of all vehicle components than can ultimately be monitored via telematics
Driver monitoring systems can be an excellent tool for helping vehicle operators improve driving performance, evaluation of recognized problem operators, and identification of operational practices or situations that lead to variances in driving. Unfortunately, the collection of data can also be used against an individual and may prove difficult to contest unless specific policies and procedures are in place. These policies and procedures should reflect that this data alone should not be used for certain levels of discipline, such as termination.

Safety and efficiency are the core principles behind driver performance monitoring. The collection of data can enable a vehicle fleet manager to assess fuel consumption, evaluate the length of time vehicle brake pads need replacement, traffic impacts, and manufacturer defects.
You can have my data when you pry it from my cold, dead, oh, never mind.
The collection of sensory data is likely not something a driver will be able to avoid. Government and private-sector employee will be governed by their organization’s policies. These policies will recognize that the organization can legally collect and share data that protect their corporate / mission interests. The embedded manner of these sensors into the vehicle will be difficult for drivers to bypass and the drivers that no not follow these policies will be subject to discipline, which could possibly include termination.
Every-day drivers are not immune to data collection either. Many insurance companies and car rental service track driver performance as a mechanism to determine rates, risk, and to monitor driver performance in accordance with their rental agreement. Variances from what was specified in microscopic text in a fifteen-page electronic rental contract could prove costly in fees, damages, or premium rates to the customer. All new passenger vehicles are equipped with an Event Data Recorder, (EDR or “Black Box”), which records speed, brake use, seat belt use, airbag status and lateral acceleration of the vehicle. Theoretically the data belongs to the driver of the vehicle, but, depending on which state you live in, the data may be accessible by everyone from the police, to insurance companies, to lawyers who file for it.
Click here for a list of rules by state:
http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/privacy-of-data-from-event-data-recorders.aspx
If you have opted for connected services like OnStar or Hyundai Blue Link, much of this same data is being systematically streamed in real-time back to a data center, along with your current position and speed, as well as other details, such as where and when you parked your car.
Now if they’d only come up with a way so your car could automatically narc on that jerk truck in front of you…

When insurance is a privilege
My parents *almost* didn’t have maternity coverage with their first pregnancy. If they hadn’t, it would have ruined them financially, and there’s a chance our family would have been in poverty, at least temporarily. There’s also a chance my sister wouldn’t have survived her birth.
But they had insurance, so that alternative reality never happened.
Technically, my mom wasn’t eligible for my dad’s company maternity coverage, because she was already pregnant when he started work. (That, btw, was because her Dalkon Shield had failed her, along with enough other women that it became the largest class action medical lawsuit of its era.) But someone advocated on their behalf and the coverage was approved.
It turns out it was needed. Badly.
My mom went into labor at 28 weeks. While she was in labor they discovered she was carrying twins (her suspicion all along but her doctors didn’t believe her). Both babies were born and immediately put on the highest level of life support — back in 1973, this was the edge of viability and if my sisters hadn’t been born in Manhattan, where they had the newest technology and procedures, they likely both would have died. Frances did die after a day of intensive care. Katherine spent the next 3 months hospitalized with round-the-clock care. She survived unscathed and is healthy today with a healthy, born-full-term kid of her own.
The experience was traumatic and horrible, but it could have been so much worse. The cost of all of this care would have easily plunged my parents into debt it would take decades to climb out of, or forced them into bankruptcy right at the start of their adult lives.
If I go back to the beginning of this scenario and imagine that they hadn’t bent the rules to give my parents the health insurance they needed, it is so easy to imagine how differently things could have gone.
This was back in 1973, but these days the out-of-pocket cost of a NICU bed in New York City if you don’t have insurance is at least $10,000 to $20,000 a day. Obviously, if you have twins you have to double that. This is how people end up with million dollar medical bills.
This would have caused massive stress (on top of the stress of most likely losing two babies). And stress gets into the body and can make you sick. It can also make you higher risk for preterm birth. Which means this whole scenario was likely to repeat in their next pregnancy (which resulted in me). Except this time they would have even fewer resources to deal with unexpected expenses, because they would already be broke and in debt. And as it turned out, although I was born full term, I also came with my fair share of unplanned medical expenses in my first couple years. And the hole would deepen.
Disparities in access to insurance widen disparities in wealth and cascade into disparities in health. If you start pregnancy healthy and with a proper safety net, you have both a better chance of a healthy pregnancy, and more resilience and resources if the unexpected or unthinkable happens. Countries that make big investments in universal coverage are doing this in large part because of this reality. Lack of insurance stunts any possibility of prosperity for those unlucky enough to need it when it isn’t there. That sets off a cascade effect that puts an ever increasing drag on families, communities, and our whole economy.
We need to agree to pay for all people’s maternity and newborn care as a society and a country, rather than relegating this to those fortunate and wealthy enough to have insurance coverage. It’s not just the right thing to do, it’s the only sustainable thing to do and it’s necessary if we are ever going to have a hope of ending disparities.
This issue is one of many reasons I’m participating in the March for Moms on the National Mall on Mother’s Day. We will be visiting legislators the Friday before (May 12). Please join us in DC or in your own community.

National Disability Insurance Scheme & social advocacy
Four challenges
by Dr Margaret Ward
Photo Howard Lake, CC BY SA 2.0
The implementation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) brings hope to people with disability and their families in their struggle for an ordinary life. It also brings new challenges to disability social advocates.
The NDIS has the ambitious goal of supporting the independence, and social and economic participation of people with disability by affording them choice and control in the planning and delivery of their supports. Put simply, the NDIS facilitates a shift in power from the service industry to the person with disability.
Australians think the NDIS is a good idea. They want people with disability to have a fair go and they consented to an increase in their medicare levy without a whimper.
Nevertheless, the disability sector understands this shift in power will not occur without a struggle, and the nation’s economic woes will eventually bite. The NDIS will require social advocates to keep the scheme ‘on song’.
Wolf Wolfensberger defined social advocacy as “speaking, acting, and writing on behalf of a disadvantaged person or group — to promote, protect and defend their welfare and justice”.
Social advocacy is not for the feint-hearted and Wolfensberger suggests advocates can be effective only if they have minimal conflict of interest, are primarily concerned with fundamental needs, and can remain “emphatically and vigorously” loyal and accountable to the people for whom they are advocating. He cautions newcomers that social advocacy comes at a high personal cost — you don’t always win.
In some countries, social advocates are imprisoned, tortured and killed as a matter of course. This is unlikely to happen in Australia, but many people have paid a high price for their advocacy to close institutions, to include children in regular schools, to get into buildings, or to seek justice through the courts.
Some of the best individual advocates are people with disability and their families themselves. They have little to lose except their money, dignity and reputation and much to gain.
The best systemic advocacy continues to be done by community organisations that have remained focused, tenacious and independent.
Certainly, governments would not have addressed the dire state of the private hostel industry, developed a guardianship regime, closed many of its institutions or considered an NDIS without compelling arguments from disability advocacy organisations.
The Hawke Government in 1986 understood that social advocacy was critical to keep its disability programs effective and relevant, and allocated funding accordingly. With the devolvement of the disability program to the States and Territories in the 1990s, state-based funding also became available.
By taking government funds social advocacy organisations had greater staying power, but they discounted Wolfensberger’s advice — have minimal conflict of interest. In this brave new world of austerity and economic rationalism, the NDIS now throws four new challenges to social advocates in the disability sector.
The first challenge is that the NDIS will rely on market forces, in the main, to ensure the effectiveness and relevance of disability services. People with disability have control over their funds and can choose who serve them, and they won’t use services that neglect, exploit or abuse them. ‘Choice’ and ‘control’ work well for those who have the capacity to envision a good life, direct their supports and stand up for themselves. They do little for those who do not have this capacity, are socially isolated, or have come to accept a diminished lifestyle after years of struggle and disempowerment. These folk are now at risk of blame, neglect and even abandonment because they do not use the power of choice afforded to them. It will be left to social advocates to promote, protect and defend their welfare in a world that is likely to judge them as undeserving.
The second challenge is that the NDIS will adopt an insurance-based approach, informed by actuarial analysis to ensure its long-term sustainability. Economist and academic, Jack Frisch, advises advocates to understand this new language of disability economics. Australians will be watching how their contributions are spent. Social advocates will be required to provide solid economic reasoning to support their arguments for human rights and social inclusion.
The third challenge requires advocates to take a broader focus than disability. The success of the NDIS depends on active engagement by mainstream sectors, including health, education, housing, business and transport. The Council of Australian Government’s National Disability Strategy 2010–2020 lays out a bold plan for this to happen. In 2015, the Strategy resembles a ‘toothless tiger’ with little accountability built in for the three levels of government involved. Social advocates will need to keep the pressure on, and remind them that the building of good lives for people with disability is everybody’s business.
The fourth challenge calls for greater financial independence. The recent withdrawal of government funding from many peak organisations does not bode well for social advocacy. It is time to think how advocacy can be done without government grants. Social advocates have demonstrated their power, tenacity and grit. They will be even more powerful once they have financial independence. During this interregnum of hope before the NDIS rolls out, social advocates would do well to position themselves in a new lean way to take on the issues that the NDIS and the harsh economic environment will bring.

After about 4 months without insurance, you will have not spent an amount of money equivalent to the extra 30% you will pay for a full year. Any coverage gap longer than 4 months is fully compensating for that surcharge — “incentivizing” 4+ month gaps.
It sure doesn’t “incentivize” becoming insured, anyhow. How does this pay for the requirement of covering pre-existing conditions?


How to get startup insurance & avoid getting sued in to oblivion
Editor’s Note: After we wrote about how we spend our money, people started asking how startup insurance works. Baremetrics is a happy customer of Founder Shield, who helped us get our insurance setup, so I asked Carl to help me put together a post to demystify some of the murky water that is business insurance. I hope this is helpful to you & your company! — Josh Pigford
The world of insurance is, seemingly, a black hole of conflicting information and sleazy salespeople who are trying to dupe you into buying something you don’t need. And between generating some good user traction, flushing out the revenue model, or closing the Series A round, insurance falls way down the list of important to-do’s.
However, proper business insurance coverage can be critical to — and often a requirement for — a startup’s success.
Here’s a breakdown of the seven main types of business insurance startups need, when you need them, how much to get, how much it will cost you and how to get them. This isn’t an exhaustive list of every kind of insurance available, but it covers the scenarios that most startups will face at some point in the life of their business.
Insurance types covered…
General Liability Insurance
Worker’s Compensation Insurance / Disability Insurance
Errors and Omissions Insurance
Cyber Liability Insurance
Key Person Insurance
Employment Practices Liability Insurance
Directors and Officers Insurance
General Liability Insurance: When a helpless child chokes on your metrics dashboard
General liability insurance is what most founders think of as “slip and fall” insurance, but it actually goes way beyond the simple office mishap.
General liability insurance covers all kinds of bodily injury and property damage caused by your company and includes the actions of your team members outside of the office as well as the use of your products by your customers.
Claim examples…
Your sales rep spills coffee on a client when meeting at a coffee shop, causing severe burns.
A child chokes on the connected wearable device you’ve designed and marketed.
A competitor sues for defamation, libel, or even copyright infringement based on the content of your website or your advertising campaign.
You’ll need this when you…
Start your company. Policies are usually inexpensive for startups (as low as $500 annually) so there’s no excuse for not having a general liability policy in place.
Sign a lease on new office space (it’ll be required by your landlord).
Sign basically any other contract with vendors, distributors and retailers. This tends to be a boilerplate contract requirement, so keep an eye out for insurance terms.
How much you need…
$1M per occurrence and $2M aggregate is the standard starting point for any startup. Some landlords and partners may want this limit bumped up to $2/4M respectively or will request that an “umbrella policy” go on top of the underlying $1/2M, but that varies by lease.
Approximate pricing: $500–2,000 per year
Worker’s Compensation Insurance / Disability Insurance: When your startup’s foosball table stops being fun and starts being Hunger Games
Worker’s Comp covers injuries to your own employees while on the job. Similarly, disability provides a source of income to injured employees when they aren’t able to perform their job.
Claim examples…
Employees injuring themselves on the job, whether at the job or not. Think slips, falls, and spills.
A programmer suffers from carpal tunnel from all the code he’s writing.
You’ll need this when you…
Have employees on payroll. The laws differ from state to state, but usually they require coverage to protect the welfare of your team. Sometimes these will be provided automatically by the state, but whoever you buy insurance from can tell you one way or the other.
How much you need…
There are statutory minimums that vary by state, and as long as you hit those minimums, you’re all set. A good starting point is usually $1M in coverage, however, because that is the limit we see most often required by contracts and the pricing difference is typically negligible.
Approximate pricing: $300–500 per salaried employee per year
Errors and Omissions Insurance: When that line of code burns everything to the ground
Errors and Omissions Insurance (E&O) covers claims against you and your company for problems with your product/service that cause a financial loss. The problem can be professional (doctor’s malpractice) or technical (newly deployed code causing errors).
This is one of the most important insurance policies for tech startups, particularly in the B2B SaaS space. The average contract tends to be large, and a bad deploy can affect tons of users at the same time, causing the damage claims to pile up.
Claim examples…
An actual bug in your SaaS marketing/sales platform that causes users to lose money — payments aren’t processed, leads aren’t recorded, etc. — that leads to a class action lawsuit.
Your product/service doesn’t live up to your customer’s expectations; the customer alleges you haven’t honored company policies or contractual obligations.
Your customer claims you’ve violated the terms of the user agreement and sues for misrepresentation or violation of contract. Even if the allegation is borderline frivolous, you’ll still have to pay a lawyer to deal with it. These costs are covered by E&O policies.
You’ll need this when you…
Launch your product and get customers. Once your product is out in the wild, you’re exposed.
Sign a contract with customers, particularly if in the B2B space or dealing with any large corporate vendors.
How much you need…
$1M is a good starting point for E&O if you’re just launching your product. It will also be the minimum you’ll see on a contract requirement. When revenues exceed $3–5M, additional coverage should be considered.
Approximate pricing: $1,500–4,000 per year
Cyber Liability Insurance: When you leave your laptop with your customer database at that fancy noodle place
Cyber liability insurance lessons the costs from data breach incidents and the loss or theft of third party data. Losses covered can include lawsuits, forensic costs, data restoration costs, breach notification costs (this is a big one), regulatory costs, and more.
Cyber policies often include “business interruption insurance” as well. This a significant piece of coverage because it covers the company’s expenses (and the lost profits, in some situations) if your company needs to temporarily prohibit access to the product after a data breach.
Claim examples…
Your AWS databases are hacked and your users sue you for leaking information.
An employee leaves a laptop or phone in a cab that’s picked up by someone who leaks private user data.
You suspect there may have been a breach and you have to notify your users to comply with individual state laws regarding breach notification procedures.
You’re hit with a DDoS attack and you have to shut down your site for a few days, causing lost profits and expenses to build up.
You’ll need this when you…
Collect user data. The data can be as basic as a name & email address. Laws vary from state to state, but this can be enough to qualify as “personally identifiable information” (“PII”), which you can be held liable for if disclosed accidentally or maliciously.
How much you need…
E&O and Cyber will usually be paired together, so the same limits will apply until some serious growth in revenues and user base occurs.
Approximate pricing: $1,500–4,000 per year (included with the cost of E&O)
Key Person Insurance: When you are The Man™ & you die
Key Person Insurance (or “Key Man Insurance”) is a life insurance policy that pays out to the company rather than family upon insured person’s death or incapacitation.
Unlike other policies, a key person insurance policy will pay out in a lump sum once after a situation triggers coverage. This is to compensate for the hefty expenses startups incur when searching for a replacement and continuing to operate in the interim.
Claim examples…
Death or permanent incapacitation of the insured person. There are typically exclusions around alcohol/drug abuse and suicide.
You’ll need this when you…
Close a round of institutional funding. Many series A and some seed investors will require Key Person insurance.
Know that your valuation is driven by your founding team and the ability to succeed lies with that essential lineup of teammates.
How much you need…
$1M is a baseline policy, but you can go lower or higher based on the amount raised and skill set of the key person. Similar to D&O, companies that have raised $8–10M+ usually get $2M in coverage per key person.
Approximate pricing: Varies widely by product, carrier, and health/age of the key person
Employment Practices Liability Insurance: When you terminate people for no reason other than you don’t like them
Employment Practices Liability Insurance (EPLI) covers claims when it comes to Human Resources within a company: hiring, firing, disciplinary action, and more.
Claim examples…
Lawsuits for violating employment laws around race/gender/age discrimination and/or discriminatory hiring/firing practices.
Sexual harassment or hostile work environment lawsuits.
Wrongful termination lawsuits.
You’ll need this when you…
Hire! If you’re ramping up hiring, you should have EPLI in place. It’s always important, but EPLI is essential as you cross the 10 employee threshold as that is when the company becomes subject to various federal employment laws. The risk exposure increases substantially at this point.
How much you need…
The average EPL claim comes in at about $400–500K and one of the most heavily hit demographics is made up of companies with <100 employees. It’s recommend to start at $1M, but if you can swing $2M, you’ll likely be better off.
Approximate pricing: $3,000–8,000 per year
Directors and Officers Insurance: When that board member goes Minority Report on everyone and tries to undermine the whole operation
Directors and Officers Insurance (D&O) insurance covers lawsuits against, wait for it, Directors or Officers of the company related to the actions taken on behalf of the company in their capacity as, you guessed it, Directors and Officers.
Claim examples…
A board member or shareholder bringing a derivative suit against the execs when they feel they’ve violated their fiduciary duties.
Alleged misrepresentations in offering documents / prospectus.
Regulatory action against the directors and officers for securities-related issues like reporting errors, failure to file Reg D forms, etc.
You’ll need this when you…
Close a round of institutional funding. Most investors will require D&O insurance.
Actively fill board seats. D&O can actually attract board members because it shields Director(s) when they make decisions on behalf of the company.
Operate in a heavily regulated industry. Federal and state regulatory agencies have a tendency to name Directors & Officers personally when sanctioning companies.
How much you need…
$1M is a standard starting point for D&O coverage. Once you raise a round of $8M+, it’s time to think about moving up to $2M+ limits.
Approximate pricing: $5,000–10,000 per year
How to get the insurance you need
There are essentially five major events that should prompt you to look in to business insurance.
Moving into a new office
Hiring employees
Signing clients
Closing a round of funding
Your business experiences rapid growth.
Really, any business insurance broker can get you set up with the insurance you need, but having someone with specific experience with startups can go a long way to getting the right type of insurance as well as avoiding over-insuring your business.
If you don’t have insurance for your startup, I highly recommend reaching out to Founder Shield. Feel free to reference their coverage page for more details.

Considering the legal basis for medicare and insurance exclusions for trans healthcare came from the political left, I’d say there was reason enough not to trust them.


Why Peer-to-Peer Insurance Is Coming Your Way
If ever there were an industry that was open and ready for radical disruption, it’s the insurance sector. That’s one reason why so many new, nimble insurance companies have sprung up in recent years with completely different business models. Of them, in my opinion, the peer-to-peer model is one of the most promising and, quite frankly, realistic.
Why? Because the insurance behemoths commonly sell expensive policies that are ‘cookie cutter’ in nature. But, suppose you were a concert violinist who owned a multi-million dollar Stradivarius violin. You would have to find a specialized insurance agency who could come up with a customized policy for your precious instrument. The concept of peer-to-peer insurance is that (continuing with the violin example) you find musicians and rare instrument aficionados around the world who all have the same specialized insurance needs that you do. You form a crowd-funding community based on trust and a common theme. The more people who pay an initial insurance premium, the smaller the premium. What binds all peer-to-peer set-ups together is that if you don’t make a claim during the course of a year, you receive a cash bonus. According to the peer-to-peer company Friendsurance, there have been cases recent years in which 94 percent of participants received some sort of year-end cash bonus.
The system works, according to experts, because crowd-funding ensures that people form like-minded digital communities. In China, families deal with an issue fairly exclusive to that country: child abduction. So families with small children have used a peer-to-peer agency known as TongJuBao to form a large group of policyholders who focus on that one social issue. Policyholders in most peer-to-peer insurance companies say that one of the greatest benefits is that the set-up discourages fraud and therefore premiums don’t skyrocket to help defray the cost of fraudulent claims.
Moreover, some peer-to-peer insurance policies that are set up to insure more basic things (home and auto) forgo any relationship with an established insurance company. If they make their calculations correctly, funds from the large pool of policy-holders can cover claims. That’s cutting out the middleman, which is what is truly disrupting the traditional insurance industry. In fact, the tag-line for the peer-to-peer company Lemonade, which claims to have received US$ 13 million in seed capital in 2015, is: ‘Forget Everything You Know About Insurance: We’ve redesigned insurance from the ground up to make it honest, instant, and delightful.’
It’s fair to say that the peer-to-peer insurance business model is based on trust and leveraging digital tools to safeguard its policyholders. Interestingly, the modern insurance industry has its roots in almost the same beliefs. At the height of the Industrial Revolution, manufacturing companies in the northeastern United States took advantage of a new invention: steam power. But in the early years of steam boilers (the 1850s) the technology was not without its glitches. Steam boilers were prone to exploding every now and then. So the owners of manufacturing plants were among the first crowd-funders in the modern era. They got together and formed a peer-to-peer insurance company that would protect their plants from costly steam boiler explosions. In some ways, therefore, the latest digital peer-to-peer insurance sector is a return to what insurance companies used to do: be customer-focused and, by extension, respond to the specialized needs of their policyholders.

Meet Jamii Africa: Microhealth Insurance Startup

Tanzanian micro-health insurance startup Jamii Africa has just raised US$750,000 seed funding for expanding across the country and into East and Central Africa.
Jamii launched in January 2015 and has built a mobile policy management platform that performs all the administration activities of an insurer, and allows users to access cheap insurance via USSD (starting at $1 per month).
Jamii plans to launch in five other African countries in 2017, and part of the plan will be to leverage their strategic partnerships with Jubilee Insurance and Vodacom Tanzania to enable mobile premium collection and a cashless facility from over 400 hospitals.
Interview with Lilian Makoi, Founder of Jamii

What inspired you to start Jamii?
Seeing the husband of my maid lose his life because they didn’t have $25 to access medical help, was a wake up call for me. I became curious to find out how big the problem was and how I could build a solution to cater for this underserved community: 50 million Tanzanians have no health insurance.

How did Jamii get to where it is today?
We started off with two people in the team, myself and Chris Rabi as my first angel investor. The team grew to 5 people while still struggling with company expenses and entrepreneurship experience. Our first break was forming a partnership with the biggest insurer in the country, Jubilee Insurance, and the biggest telecom, Vodacom Tanzania.
Our biggest break was getting into an accelerator program, the Barclays Accelerator powered by Techstars. It was there that we got to understand the value of our innovation, how to communicate it, build a financial model and test out as many strategies as we could.
This helped us go to market faster and the right way. In no time we were conversant with the startup world, started raising and grew valuable networks. This enabled us to raise our seed round $750k which now places us nicely for regional expansion.
How has the Barclays Techstars Accelerator helped shape the business?
The Barclays Accelerator equipped us with the required business design, management and growth skills we badly needed. Through the program we gained amazing connections and introductions that become investors and mentors. We were able to understand what kind of funding we needed, what percentage had to be donors, and what had to be a commercial raise. By associating with the brands Barclays Africa and Techstars, we’ve eased the journey to raising funds, and growing our partnerships.

How do you think as a startup you can get the most out of mentorship?
I strongly believe in mentors to be a vital part of a startup’s success. However, I personally believe it’s not so much about the number of mentors that you may have, but about the fit between the mentor and the company. Having a good fit allows you to make the most out of the relationship — build great partnerships, learn important lessons, and embrace opportunities.
How will you use the $750k and where do you hope to see the business by the end of 2018?
With our seed raise, we’ll take our marketing strategy to market and impact the lives of 720,000 by 2018. We have amazing partners, a great team and fantastic strategy that only needed funding to change the world!)
What advice do you have for startups who want to raise money?
Two words: great product!

Expanding Innovation Into The Insurance Industry
Ingredients Needed to Make A Change
Show Notes and Key Takeaways (Access the full transcript here)
The Wellthie Mission
[01:21] Sally Poblete: I’m a former health insurance executive from Anthem. Also a licensed insurance broker and despite my industry expertise like most people out there I found the process of choosing and buying insurance to be quite cumbersome.
[01:36] Sally: I set out to make this process using technology simple design and a focus on education to be much more simple and engaging for businesses and individuals. What we offer is a modern and smart marketplace whereby businesses and individuals with the help of their broker can find the most affordable insurance for them. We license this technology to insurance carriers and brokers who are eager to have engaging and effective e-commerce marketplaces.
Expanding Innovation Into The Insurance Industry
[02:32] Unity Stoakes: Why are we seeing so much innovation today specifically in the insurance industry? It seems like there’s a big need but what’s going on today? What are the conditions and why is it so needed?
[02:47] Sally: Insurances are a really interesting industry. First of all, it’s gigantic. There are almost a trillion dollars in premium in the health sector alone. Second when you think about insurance you often think about managing risk and regulation. Those two things are not at all synonymous with innovation and disruption. Third, it’s a very old Industry. It’s at among the fortune 500 companies who are insurance. In the insurance industry the average age is 95 years old.
[03:24] Sally: This old huge and what we believe is you know largely unaddressed in terms of technological innovation is ripe for lots of creativity simplicity and innovation today.
The Aha Moment: Starting Wellthie
[04:08] Sally: The Affordable Care Act as you know has broad significant market expansion to people buying insurance and needing insurance because they are required to do so by the Affordable Care Act. Secondly, the Affordable Care Act has brought more transparency in standardization in the way that insurance prices are determined where previously that was pretty opaque and you know kind of in a black box. The third is that the industry has gone retail and to be a successful retail one must engage the end consumer and it’s no longer sufficient to have a strong brand as an insurance carrier to also be a successful retailer.
[04:52] Sally: Last but certainly not least we are in the age of the digital consumer where we all are used to seamless 24–7 convenient experiences in all aspects of our lives and so expect that from purchasing insurance as well. Yet, we rely on and benefit from the help of experts who help make this very big important purchase a confident one. So, that’s exactly what we’re doing. Wellthie’s mission to simplify and modernize the process but also help the experts in the form of brokers and other intermediaries support their customers
Ingredients Needed to Make A Change
[05:38] Unity: ..At the heart of this challenge here is we’ve got this legacy industry as you said that’s been around for a hundred years and longer. It’s very complicated in the entire way they’ve been selling, is completely changing. Who do you think is going to crack this code? Obviously, Wellthie is focusing on it but what are the ingredients needed to be able to really simplify this very complex business?
[06:23] Sally: We are industry experts who have come out of this complicated, nuanced industry and innovating from essentially within and partnering with those incumbents to help Innovate. We think that that domain expertise coupled with the rest of our team’s technology and innovation expertise are the key ingredients to making a change. Our mission is in our team’s passion for doing this, is so strong, but at the same time, we have a healthy respect for the regulation in the nuance frankly. The differences in the markets and the distribution channels and the products that often are overlooked by pure tech companies who may not realize just how entrenched and how complicated the existing system is. But because we understand that we have a good grounding in the opportunities to pick first and where to innovate next.
A Collaborative Approach to Change
[07:27] Unity: So it sounds like your strategy is more of a collaborative, focus on collaboration with industry from the beginning as opposed to completely going around like many technology companies sort of do in healthcare?
[07:42] Sally: Yeah I think so. I think that collaborative approach has really been a key to our success. We count today in terms of our customer’s insurance companies who have leveraged our technology and are now leading in terms of their own innovation, and as well as working with brokers small businesses and individuals. So I think that that’s a great way to put it and really proud of the way that we’ve approached the industry today.
Advice for the New Entrepreneur
[09:40] Sally: I used to think I had to have the perfect idea or all of the resources or things in place in order to start a company and what I’ve learned through the journey is that so much has been certainly having a focus and having a mission is very important but so much of how we’ve approached the market has been in response to the feedback from our customers and the experiences we’ve had. So, it’s been more iterative than having everything right from the get-go.
[10:11] Sally: So I’d say to the aspiring entrepreneurs out there to take the plunge. To go out there and take the first step and I think there’s no substitute to actually hearing and listening to market feedback to tweak and perfect that and get that product market fit.
[10:33] Sally: I think the other thing more so I’d say the things that I try to share with my own children is building resilience and practicing resilience every day because the constant onslaught of challenges and change and rejection and lots and lots of other difficulties on the road to entrepreneurship require a soft healthy dose of resilience and frankly gratitude for the accomplishments that we’ve got me to date.
Sally, on Keeping a Positive Mindset
[11:12] Unity: One of the big challenges as you alluded to all these ups and downs as an entrepreneur. What do you do personally to keep a positive mindset or maybe hobbies that you do to have fun and sort of get through the challenging times of your journey?
[11:32] Sally: Yeah. Those ups and downs really are a part of life. I’d say I’m proud to have two inspiring daughters and I think them and my husband are what balances me every day and when I get home and know that they’re happy and healthy and that the home life is good. That really provides good perspective that the ups and downs of entrepreneurship like parenthood are just that and there’re more highs than there are low so life is good.
